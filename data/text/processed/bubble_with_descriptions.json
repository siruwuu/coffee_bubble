They also have a walnut barista milk. \n\nAlso, when you say oat milk is making your heart rate go up, are you sure that that’s not the actual caffeine in the coffee you are drinking which has an actual effect of making your heart rate go up? do you have an oat allergy? \n\nFor drinking my favorite milk is Plant Strong Oat and Walnut because it has dates blended into it and the sweetness tastes so much like regular milk. There is also bored cow which is a fermented sugar milk, fermented into whey, so it’s very similar to milk. Also, there are recipes online of making barista friendly plant milks that foam well.\n\nI actually relate to this a lot because my cholesterol got high and I was not even eating that much meat, but I was having full fat dairy milk coffee every day and then I decided I wanted to go vegan but the last thing that I gave up that was hard for me to give up was dairy based lattes and cappuccinos. However, now I don’t even miss it, you just have to explore the different options and accept that oat milk is gonna have a different flavor, so are all these different nut milks. And it’s not a bad flavor, it’s the flavor of plants, it’s the flavor of nuts, nuts, have a certain sweetness, but they also have a certain bitterness. And coffee itself, is a bitter seed. So it’s not a crazy flavor to get used to, it’s just an adjustment. I remember when I first tasted coffee when I was a kid. I thought it tasted absolutely disgusting.",

Like the smell but was never big on the taste.\n\nI have night owl tendencies, so generally I don't feel productive at work until the PM hours. I thought I'd give coffee another try to help me wake up faster. I picked up some Starbucks canned espresso with light cream and actually enjoyed the taste. Hard to say if the caffeine had an effect. I don't think it helped me feel more awake, but I think it got rid of some of the morning grogginess.\n\nI could just keep buying these but I'd rather opt for a cheaper bulk option. I did some searching and came across 'cold brew'. Supposedly this method results in less acidity, less bitterness, and more caffeine. So I bought Starbucks cold brew concentrate. The instructions say mix 180mL with 180 mL water. I used 180 mL milk instead. It's not as good as the canned espresso. Aftertaste is still too bitter for my liking. Maybe I need to use whole milk instead of 1%? Then I added 5g of sugar, the same amount as in the espresso. Still didn't taste as good, which makes sense because the sugar is less diluted in the espresso.\n\nThen I looked into the brewing method for the espresso. Apparently it is brewed using the ristretto method. Maybe the better taste is because of this?\n\nAny suggestions on how to replicate this flavor at home? Or is there no other way than to add more sugar and cream? Do I need an espresso machine?",

I really like the aftertaste it leaves a very pleasant mouthfeel. I think it will open up more I am still on the early side.\n\n**Subtext Daniel Caro Washed Chiroso** \\- Similar vibe to the last couple mejorados I have been trying. Dates and stone fruit is mostly what I get. I love this cup profile. If the rest of my daily cups could just taste like this bag I would be happy. It has been very easy to brew and lovely.\n\n**Subtext Sebastian Garces Washed Enepei** \\- Never heard of this varietal before, not sure it is even technically a true varietal yet. This may be the first time I have not gotten anything resembling the notes on the bag from Subtext. They note cola, red apple, and blue fruit. My cups have been pretty hollow and woody/green tasting.

I let it rest for 2 months and I still don't enjoy it. The only way I found it somewhat enjoyable was blending it with other coffee. I get a pretty bitter aftertaste and of course notes of lychee.\n\n**S&W Rwanda Dukorere Kawa Bukure Natural** \\- This one was pretty decent, not quite up to the standard of kenyas and natural ethiopias I have gotten from S&W.

I believe espresso loses less by keeping the grounds under pressure but it's not a batch brew. \n\nBased on their patent, Cometeer deal with this by using a centrifuge to extract all the brew from the grounds. I occasionally make espressos in a batch and freeze them in silicone containers in the freezer for an americano later, the results are tasty. But it takes too much time.

But don’t recall being too impatient today. I usually let the water sit for a minute before adding it to the French press.\n\nAnyway, about that flavour, first time I noticed it was in Mexico at an all inclusive resort about 20 years ago, specifically in the tomatoes. I’ve only experienced that once again since, in a tomato salsa from a taco stand, and now a third time today in my coffee.

Either new or something I'll need to hunt for in antique shops. I'm fully aware a little battery operated scale will serve my needs perfectly. I will get one eventually for travel and convenience but hopefully you'll hear me out first \n\nMy coffee set-up as it is so far is completely manual. \n\nIt consists of my 1950s mug, 1920s Spong & Co No.1 coffee grinder, my Great Grandmothers percolator she gifted me, and several other older kitchen appliances. \n\nI also have a medium sized Birchleaf coffee grinder (Looks exactly like the full sized ones you would see in the early 18th century in grocery stores), London pottery coffee grinder, Moka pot, a few other percolators of various brands, Chemex, and a portable manual pump expesso brewer. Several of these are gifts as well (Likely because I enjoy making everyone coffee)\n\nI love doing stuff manually because it brings me closer to what I'm working with and I find it rather peaceful/relaxing. I could say more but I already risk coming across as a coffee snob as it is.😹\n\nI'm very new to weighing my coffee and have been using the \"Well it looks good enough\" or measuring scoop method. So I'm hoping to up my coffee game \n\nAll the videos I've watched on YouTube or read about when it comes to learning how to weight coffee always uses a digital scale. There's not really much information out there for manual mechanical scales and coffee. \n\nI've considered using several other larger scales but I think it's possible they'd be overkill. I wouldn't mind a large scale but something at least wealdy to bring out when I make coffee would be nice. Something like a Taylor Kitchen scale perhaps?\n\nThe TLDR version of this is I think an automatic digital coffee scale will throw off my set-up and mess up my shelf appeal as of right now. \n\nThank you to anyone who even took the time to read this 😸\n\nEdit: I have no budget",

Classic Italian espresso is usually made from a blend of both Arabica and Robusta coffee, with a ratio of around 60/40. Arabica coffee is not great at producing crema and can be a bit thin. In contrast, Robusta coffee is great at producing crema, but can be too bitter for some, though it has more caffeine than Arabica.\n\nVietnamese coffee is 100% Robusta. I got my hands on a Phin filter, after going to a Vietnamese restaurant. I fell in love with the full bodied Smokey flavor. In Vietnam the government invested in the research and development of the Robusta coffee sector. It's hearty, insect resistance, and faster maturation as apposed to Arabica was an easy win. Vietnam grows about 40% of the worlds Robusta coffee. The history of how Vietnam became a world coffee producer is super interesting. I'll link a video does a good idea of explaining the key points. \n\nI roast an India Parchment Peaberry Robusta at work. It's a beautiful coffee, and is a bestseller at the cafe's. We recommend it when someone says they want strong coffee, or they need a pick-me-up(more caffeine). Because Robusta is less expensive, we often sell out, so the demand is high. As espresso pulls beautifully 1cm of long standing crema easy. It looks a amazing when pulled into a glass espresso cup, it has these three distinct layers/bands. It just takes super long time to properly dial in so we only have it on the machine maybe once a season, and only if I'm working it.",

I have my coffee station pic posted on here, you can see it my profile if you haven't already checked. \n\nCrema is kind of a misnomer as a scale for good espresso. Coffee has these foaming agents in it that trap the CO2 as its escaping from the solution after being under pressure. Along with fine coffee particles this collectively gets called \"Crema\". If you ever taste crema by itself its not very tasty. We have a $26,000 espresso machine at work and depending on the age, and type of coffee we are pulling we can get beautiful photo worthy shots(that taste terrible) or ugly as hell shots(that taste great) and everything in between. I was trained by this \"Old School\" Barista a few years ago. He really drilled into me the finer points of dialing in espresso. Coffee that is between 10 days and a month old pulls the best in my opinion. For best taste I find most coffees fall between 10 and 20 days (as espresso). If its an Arabica/Robusta blend or pure Robusta your guaranteed crema in most cases. 100% Arabica will have crema for a short while, but don't expect the mouthfeel be on par with a blend.",

After blowing too much cash on fancy beans that didnt click with me, I started writing batch numbers and origins down with quick notes like \"fruity\" or \"chocolate bomb\" or just \"meh\". Now I kinda know what regions I prefer for espresso (Ethiopia and Colombia usually slap) and which roasters nail my preferred profile. Water quality matters almost as much tho - when i moved apartments my exact same bean setup suddenly tasted totally different until I started filtering.",
