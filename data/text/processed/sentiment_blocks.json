They also have a walnut barista milk. \n\nAlso, when you say oat milk is making your heart rate go up, are you sure that that’s not the actual caffeine in the coffee you are drinking which has an actual effect of making your heart rate go up? do you have an oat allergy? \n\nFor drinking my favorite milk is Plant Strong Oat and Walnut because it has dates blended into it and the sweetness tastes so much like regular milk. There is also bored cow which is a fermented sugar milk, fermented into whey, so it’s very similar to milk. Also, there are recipes online of making barista friendly plant milks that foam well.\n\nI actually relate to this a lot because my cholesterol got high and I was not even eating that much meat, but I was having full fat dairy milk coffee every day and then I decided I wanted to go vegan but the last thing that I gave up that was hard for me to give up was dairy based lattes and cappuccinos. However, now I don’t even miss it, you just have to explore the different options and accept that oat milk is gonna have a different flavor, so are all these different nut milks. And it’s not a bad flavor, it’s the flavor of plants, it’s the flavor of nuts, nuts, have a certain sweetness, but they also have a certain bitterness. And coffee itself, is a bitter seed. So it’s not a crazy flavor to get used to, it’s just an adjustment. I remember when I first tasted coffee when I was a kid. I thought it tasted absolutely disgusting.",

    "text": "Coffee Noob: replicating Starbucks Canned Espresso Light.\n\nI'm 33 years old and somehow I've gotten through life so far without drinking coffee. Like the smell but was never big on the taste.\n\nI have night owl tendencies, so generally I don't feel productive at work until the PM hours. I thought I'd give coffee another try to help me wake up faster. I picked up some Starbucks canned espresso with light cream and actually enjoyed the taste. Hard to say if the caffeine had an effect. I don't think it helped me feel more awake, but I think it got rid of some of the morning grogginess.\n\nI could just keep buying these but I'd rather opt for a cheaper bulk option. I did some searching and came across 'cold brew'. Supposedly this method results in less acidity, less bitterness, and more caffeine. So I bought Starbucks cold brew concentrate. The instructions say mix 180mL with 180 mL water. I used 180 mL milk instead. It's not as good as the canned espresso. Aftertaste is still too bitter for my liking. Maybe I need to use whole milk instead of 1%? Then I added 5g of sugar, the same amount as in the espresso. Still didn't taste as good, which makes sense because the sugar is less diluted in the espresso.\n\nThen I looked into the brewing method for the espresso. Apparently it is brewed using the ristretto method. Maybe the better taste is because of this?\n\nAny suggestions on how to replicate this flavor at home? Or is there no other way than to add more sugar and cream? Do I need an espresso machine?",

I really like the aftertaste it leaves a very pleasant mouthfeel. I think it will open up more I am still on the early side.\n\n**Subtext Daniel Caro Washed Chiroso** \\- Similar vibe to the last couple mejorados I have been trying. Dates and stone fruit is mostly what I get. I love this cup profile. If the rest of my daily cups could just taste like this bag I would be happy. It has been very easy to brew and lovely.\n\n**Subtext Sebastian Garces Washed Enepei** \\- Never heard of this varietal before, not sure it is even technically a true varietal yet. This may be the first time I have not gotten anything resembling the notes on the bag from Subtext. They note cola, red apple, and blue fruit. My cups have been pretty hollow and woody/green tasting. I am hoping if I let it rest longer I get something more enjoyable.

I let it rest for 2 months and I still don't enjoy it. The only way I found it somewhat enjoyable was blending it with other coffee. I get a pretty bitter aftertaste and of course notes of lychee.\n\n**S&W Rwanda Dukorere Kawa Bukure Natural** \\- This one was pretty decent, not quite up to the standard of kenyas and natural ethiopias I have gotten from S&W. Which was kinda to be expected but I like trying other countries in africa. I have had good cups from Burundi, Congo, and Uganda. I noted plum and black tea notes. Was hoping for more berry/stone fruit, but the acidity/tartness wasn't coming through for me.",

    "text": "Coffee making is an art.  You can make good coffee using pretty much any method, IF you tune your method to your taste.  Not everyone has the same tastes.  Percolators are easy to get wrong.  You need to pay attention to perk time from the beginning of water appearing in the knob.  Different people like different spans.  Also, the rate of percolation is critical.  At a rolling boil, the water is too hot.  On a gas stove, I run the burner just a little above low and time the process from when it first starts to actually perk, not the first time water appears in the bulb, but a few seconds later when it starts repeating.  Up to that point, the heat is on high.  I turn the gas down to \\_near\\_ low and let it go.  Once my preferred cooking time is up, I pull it off the heat.  While many like to keep their coffee warm somehow, this gradually makes the coffee increasingly bitter.  My parents used to keep the pot warm on the stove on the smallest gas burner.  That creates a corrosively bitter, acidic coffee, drinkable only with lots of cream and sugar, and I prefer either black or just a little added milk.  I find it easier to just reheat the coffee by the cup in a microwave or on the stove in a small sauce pan.",

He produced single origin products because of the demand and several bigger clients required it. His response was telling.\n\n“This is the biggest hoax and scam in the industry. It started out with good intentions, but it’s no longer that. Small local growers are losing their farms still because the large scale farms are still taking over and then using labor that is being paid below a living wage in slave like conditions. To top it off, 95% of the coffee tastes like shit. First time coffee shops owners are bankrupting because they bought into a gimmick that has the selling bad coffee that causes their business to dry up because no one likes the coffee. Their only response is then to commit to selling the overly sweet American style coffee desert drinks instead of focusing on quality blended products that produce a balanced taste in all formats.”\n\nHe goes on for quite a bit longer, but I’ll save that for another time. \n\nBlended coffee wins out 75% in large scale blind tests.\n\nEnd rant",

Classic Italian espresso is usually made from a blend of both Arabica and Robusta coffee, with a ratio of around 60/40. Arabica coffee is not great at producing crema and can be a bit thin. In contrast, Robusta coffee is great at producing crema, but can be too bitter for some, though it has more caffeine than Arabica.\n\nVietnamese coffee is 100% Robusta. I got my hands on a Phin filter, after going to a Vietnamese restaurant. I fell in love with the full bodied Smokey flavor. In Vietnam the government invested in the research and development of the Robusta coffee sector. It's hearty, insect resistance, and faster maturation as apposed to Arabica was an easy win. Vietnam grows about 40% of the worlds Robusta coffee. The history of how Vietnam became a world coffee producer is super interesting. I'll link a video does a good idea of explaining the key points. \n\nI roast an India Parchment Peaberry Robusta at work. It's a beautiful coffee, and is a bestseller at the cafe's. We recommend it when someone says they want strong coffee, or they need a pick-me-up(more caffeine). Because Robusta is less expensive, we often sell out, so the demand is high. As espresso pulls beautifully 1cm of long standing crema easy. It looks a amazing when pulled into a glass espresso cup, it has these three distinct layers/bands. It just takes super long time to properly dial in so we only have it on the machine maybe once a season, and only if I'm working it.",

However, now I don’t even miss it, you just have to explore the different options and accept that oat milk is gonna have a different flavor, so are all these different nut milks.

This may be the first time I have not gotten anything resembling the notes on the bag from Subtext. They note cola, red apple, and blue fruit. My cups have been pretty hollow and woody/green tasting. I am hoping if I let it rest longer I get something more enjoyable. My first real miss after trying 8+ bags of Subtext.\n\nI still think their reserve subscription is the best subscription I have tried for the price and I am bummed I am skipping next month after I saw what they are offering.\n\n**S&W Colombia Santa Monica Lychee Coferment** \\- I kinda knew going into it that I would not like this coffee. I let it rest for 2 months and I still don't enjoy it. The only way I found it somewhat enjoyable was blending it with other coffee. I get a pretty bitter aftertaste and of course notes of lychee.\n\n**S&W Rwanda Dukorere Kawa Bukure Natural** \\- This one was pretty decent, not quite up to the standard of kenyas and natural ethiopias I have gotten from S&W. Which was kinda to be expected but I like trying other countries in africa. I have had good cups from Burundi, Congo, and Uganda. I noted plum and black tea notes. Was hoping for more berry/stone fruit, but the acidity/tartness wasn't coming through for me.",

    "text": "That's a tough one. The problem is those machines are not designed to make real espresso. Even if you could find a non pressurized basket, the machine very probably cannot generate 9 or so bar needed for one, (necessitating the pressurized basket). So you're very probably stuck with it. Those are designed for preground coffee, not properly fine espresso, and dark commodity roasts, not specialty.\n\nYour best bet is probably to get a servicable grinder that will last you until you upgrade the machine at some point. Find a grind setting that works with the beans you like (and again, for this machine and basket, that's going to be on the darker side) and do your best to dial it in. The point is that when you buy preground, you can't dial it in each shot. You're stuck. \n\nSometimes these challenges are fun, other times frustrating. I hope you manage a combination of grinder and bean that gets you something drinkable. Your wife sounds like a sweetheart, make her some good espresso.\n\nOh and with that wand, you're likely stuck with it as it is. You're not going to get microfoam paint from that machine.

First time coffee shops owners are bankrupting because they bought into a gimmick that has the selling bad coffee that causes their business to dry up because no one likes the coffee.

(Everyone's #1 favorite in summer)\n\nPink base, Blue Raspberry, Passion Fruit, Guava, Club Soda & Coconut Milk (my personal go to and #1 favorite)\n\nBlue base, Blue Raspberry, White Peach, Pineapple, Club Soda, & Coconut Milk (can sub pineapple for Coconut syrup and add pineapple juice) \n\n\nGood Coconut milk is a matter of opinion but I like Aroy D, it's not sweetened & and it doesn't separate until the ice starts really melting. Lotus Oat Super Cream is amazing because it doesn't separate, but the level of sweetness is pretty unbearable in most drinks. Haven't tried their Coconut super cream. Any other suggestions on non dairy milk would be great, btw!!\n\nGood syrup flavor combos I like using in different drinks: guava & passion fruit, white peach & cantaloupe, watermelon & cantaloupe, Blue Raspberry & Coconut, blue raspberry & pomegranate,  etc. I also try to mix a sweet syrup with a sour/tart syrup to balance and contrast the sweetness. Very sweet &/or very sour flavors are also evened out by vanilla, almond, or coconut. A splash of fruit juice like orange or pineapple or mango can help wake the taste buds up. \n\nHope this helps someone who is in the same boat I was in last year.",

I can shovel any powdered green tea into a bag and label it ceremonial grade, because there are no accepted official objective criteria for grading matcha.\n\nchampagne is made in the champagne region of France. same grapes grown in California must be labeled \"sparkling wine\". one cannot legally call whiskey \"scotch\" unless it's made in Scotland. the usda establishes grading criteria for meat, eggs, dairy, etc etc. these are distinctions enshrined in international law and regulation. on the other hand, there is no standard or regulatory body that dictates what can or can't be called \"wasabi. most of what's sold as wasabi contains little or no wasabi root, which is quite rare and expensive. most of it is horseradish with green coloring added, often from green tea leaves. \n\nit's trendy now in specialty coffee to trace the origins of the beans down to the producer or farm level, and some roasters will have pictures of the farm or farmers on their websight. in Japan they have been doing something similar for decades, with pictures of the farmers or chefs on their respective specialty products. that's the level of selection that is used when deciding on tea for a tea ceremony. there is no grading system or regulatory body to decide and label that for the consumer. the tea ceremony is not even a common, everyday thing, and there isn't a massive production of tea for it because of its relatively low consumption.\n\nwhen i was at coffee fest recently i was surprised at how many booths of matcha wholesalers there were. it's clear that the sudden boom in matcha sales could not be supplied by the relatively small niche producers of shade grown Japanese matcha, and, like any other trend, marketing drives sales. since there is no appellation, no grading standard, and interwebs nitwits have made it imperitive that your matcha have the magic words on it- even though i doubt most American consumers could taste the difference between matcha and hunmatsucha (especially in an iced latte with sweetener and flavored syrup) as they are both the same species of green tea leaves. there's no provinence to any of it so your \"ceremonial grade\" matcha is probably just green tea from China or Vietnam. \n\nu/ShitHammersGroom, there is no such thing as \"ceremonial grade\" matcha. this is the crux of the matter. you keep insisting that such a thing exists, but provide no reference to back up your claim. OP did. further, they didn't seem do this research to \"prove their customer wrong\". they seem to have done it out of genuine curiosity as to what constitutes \"ceremonial grade\", and discovered the emperor has no clothes. their posting seemed to revolve around whether they should educate their customers to this somewhat deceptive practice, or not. i say they should abstain, because there are plenty of people willing to double down and say the emperor looks fabulous in their new regalia and accuse anyone who says otherwise of ignorance.",

You can adjust the time of the first brew to you liking as well\n\n**Tips:**\n\nSoaking the bloom has given us enchanced sweetness and body in out cup, we have found it nicer than a standard V60 recipe aswell.\n\nFurther you can play with water temp in the bloom, we have brewed the bloom with room temperature water and using hot water in the last two pours. This makes and interesting cup.\n\nFinally you can extend the brew time but splitting the last two pours into 3 or 4 pours for a longer brew time\n\nYou can also change the paper filers you are using, higher flow rate papers will speed up brew time for example\n\n**Hope this helps**",

    "text": "You've picked up one of the most clarity focus burr set that sacrifices the body experience. \n\nTL;DR:\n\n* Finer grind with less agitation\n* Thinner filter\n* Flat bottom brewer\n* Reduce ratios\n* Lower water temp (with higher agitation)\n* Multi pour techniques \n* Even extraction (underrated)\n\n\\---\n\nOn Moccamaster it would be extremely tedious to get some body back, as you would basically need to use the faster flow and turn it off every 20-30 seconds, once there is enough water. Try to experiment with stirring the bloom and possibly removing carafe, so you can also get some immersion going. But this is extremely involved process that can be controlled easier on some dripper.\n\nHowever on hand brews all you need is multi pour technique, where you can pour once you almost see the bed. E.g. 4-5 pours of 50g, but be careful with agitation with multi pour recipes, as it is going to push extraction to the moon. To offset this extraction gain, we need to either reduce the temperature or massively reduce agitation. And this concept goes hand in hand with finer grind sizes - more exposed area for extraction to take place, thus we cannot agitate much nor use very hot water (95+) as that would speed up the extraction. Also you could experiment with thinner papers that will allow more oils and fines to pass through, giving you more mouthfeel. \n\nFlat bottom brewer is best combination with any clarify focus burr in my opinion, as your technique can produce both super clean cups, as well as more body focused cups. These drippers promote more even extraction, which leads to less areas being underextracted, giving you a sweeter cup, which carries the body as well. \n\nFinally I suppose having SSP MP 64mm burrs comes with a preference for light roast, but going to medium roast could help as well.",

Like the smell but was never big on the taste.\n\nI have night owl tendencies, so generally I don't feel productive at work until the PM hours. I thought I'd give coffee another try to help me wake up faster. I picked up some Starbucks canned espresso with light cream and actually enjoyed the taste. Hard to say if the caffeine had an effect. I don't think it helped me feel more awake, but I think it got rid of some of the morning grogginess.\n\nI could just keep buying these but I'd rather opt for a cheaper bulk option. I did some searching and came across 'cold brew'. Supposedly this method results in less acidity, less bitterness, and more caffeine. So I bought Starbucks cold brew concentrate. The instructions say mix 180mL with 180 mL water. I used 180 mL milk instead. It's not as good as the canned espresso. Aftertaste is still too bitter for my liking. Maybe I need to use whole milk instead of 1%? Then I added 5g of sugar, the same amount as in the espresso. Still didn't taste as good, which makes sense because the sugar is less diluted in the espresso.\n\nThen I looked into the brewing method for the espresso. Apparently it is brewed using the ristretto method. Maybe the better taste is because of this?\n\nAny suggestions on how to replicate this flavor at home? Or is there no other way than to add more sugar and cream? Do I need an espresso machine?",

If yes to both - that would surprise me that you don’t notice a difference. \n\nThat said, the Pietro gives my palate a lot more clarity and acidity than the 078 - if I had to put a percentage on it, it would be ~20%, which is considerable. The 078 is a better “all around” grind profile, meaning if you do medium and dark roast with the 078, it will all be pretty flattering to an extent - things are always pretty juicy and balanced. The Pietro is more of a precision tool, some coffees - at least for me, can be downright bad on the Pietro - as the clarity and separation can highlight the errors/issues in a roast, or can put the spotlight on a flavor you don’t particularly want. \n\nFor instance Standout Coffee has a LA MURALLA washed Papayo 36 hour aerobic fermented coffee and it’s tasty and balanced on my xBloom Studio using the built in grinder (similar to a K Ultra) and the tasting notes of: juicy limeade acidity, pomegranate, blood orange sweetness and a clean & floral finish are all there and while the citrus is the forward note, there’s pretty good balance. I can’t taste much of the pomegranate and the floral finish is easy to lose in the cup. That said - it’s delicious and easy to drink out of the xBloom Studio. \n\nIf I make the same coffee and bypass the xBloom Grinder and use the Pietro instead (thus taking prep, pour, agitation and other variables out of the equation) it becomes a very serious acid bomb and will literally leave a sparkling finish on the roof of your mouth. It’s sensational, but it morphs into a very different beast, and you can really taste the pomegranate and floral notes, but the limeade literally kicks you in the mouth and is so abundant, it no longer tastes like “coffee” per say. It’s not something I’d want to idly drink while sitting on a conference call, and frankly would be somewhat unpleasant in that manner, but from a tasting glass - letting it cool, slurping it in small sips and really nerding out on it - it’s spectacular. \n\nIt’s a fantastic piece of kit, and there’s a reason that so many folks talk about how amazing it is, out with the inferior (to other high end manual grinders) UX and even when they have access to grinders 4-6X more expensive, end up still using it daily. The elephant in the room is the ~15lbs of coffee you have to go through before you see the full magic of the burrs, but if you stick with it and get to that point, you’re basically going to be at the top of the flavor separation hill - or at least within the margin of error. If the Pietro doesn’t provide enough separation for you - it either isn’t being used properly, isn’t seasoned, is defective in some way, or you have unrealistic expectations. \n\nThat said - I’m excited to see if there is some new world unlocked by the VS6 or if that’s total BS. I just ordered it yesterday, so it’ll probably be at least a month or two until I’m comfortable rendering a strong opinion, unless it’s defective or broken in some way. I’m guessing it’ll be good, and likely as good (possibly a single digit % better) as the Pietro, but my guess it that the Pietro is a better package/value - given its small size, weight, nothing really to go wrong with it, solid build quality and unflappable consistency.",

Definitely balanced and interesting.  \n\nThe floral notes decreased and I could see why some might seek these flavor notes.

I think I would be upgrading to a Hario air kettle, as soon as I was able. Still… That may be making it’s way into a travel kit at some point.\n\nI dialed in the India robusta this morning, at the main cafe. It only took me 3 attempts to pull something drinkable. By the 6th pull it was something enjoyable, so maybe 6-7 min to dial in this morning.  To be fair Ive been drinking it at home since our conversation last week so I kind of had an idea of what I wanted, kicking around in my head. I’m decent enough at dialing in to be called “the fixer” at work. \n\nEspresso machines are crazy. Depending on the the machine and grinder setup, you have control over water volume, water temperature, water flow, grind setting, and espresso dose. This is all to achieve a an espresso shot that is roughly double the initial espresso weight you used, within the desired 20-30 second shot duration. Get any one of those things wrong and it can ruin the shot. Get them all right, your still not guaranteed something tasty. That just the initial things you have to factor in. The type of coffee, the origin, the roast level, the age of the green beans(before roasting), the age of the beans(after roasting) all have an effect on the end shot. Most people aren’t privy to all this information, and are anyways used to an espresso blend or 100% Arabica. This particular India Robusta is only peaberries, and has this syrupy consistency and a smoky/ sweet flavor, no acidity. Robusta in general has a bad reputation, but there are some really good farms/estates at the moment. Anyhow the hour long dial in estimate was based on my own experiences, and reports from customers. They were happy with the end result, but they all said it took time.",

But better in quality since they were mostly distributed through vanity shops or department stores.\n\nKrups etc are Wal-Mart distributed appliances, and yes you can still make good espresso if you know the game. But shot to shot, you may lose temperature, and may have to wait longer to heat up,  steaming milk may become a challenge, etc.\n\nI had one of those. They were fun to learn and easy to fix. and upgraded to Delonghi Dedica and it is better esp. in steaming, maintaining temperature, control shot times etc. My 2 cents. \n\n\n\nGo hang around in the espresso sub and choose something in your price point. This is an \"enthusiast's\" hobby and will require steep learning. and you will need a good quality grinder, and other accessories to enjoy which may become costly.\n\nAlternatively you can try Nespresso too.

If you just want milk based drinks, it's usually not necessary.\n\nOther than that, the reliability of the machine itself is super important. They're expensive. Some are tanks that last a decade, others are prone to leaks and failure.\n\nIntegrated grinders are usually a gimmick, just get your own grinder (KinGrinder6 if you're a cheap bastard like me who's okay with hand grinders).

It's not that a Sage machine couldn't produce 15 bars...it could. But it *doesn't* because that's not ideal for pulling good shots. It bleeds pressure off to maintain a consistent 9 bars which is the ideal pressure for espresso shots. \n\n\nFurthermore, most superauto machines have pretty horrible grinders. A really good espresso grinder is pricey for a reason. Again, consistency and quality. They can grind fine enough for espresso without a bunch of fines (ironically named imo) so that you can get a good shot without a bunch of channeling.

Around 9 bars is the best pressure for brewing espresso. However, the pumps used in many espresso machines produce different pressures at different flow rates. To ensure they will always be generating enough pressure at all flow rates, most pumps are rated at 15 to 20 bars maximum.\n\nBetter quality espresso machines have pressure control that bleeds off the excess pressure and provide a constant 9 bars. Less expensive machines like the Krups eliminate the pressure control, and blast the espresso with full pump pressure. Then, they tout their \"15 bar pressure\" as a feature, while it is actually bad.",

There is a reason why La Marzocco, Nuova Simonelli, Slayer, Rocket, Gaggia, etc. are well known since their machines can last 10 years or so.\n\nFactors where you can control pressure, temperature, flow, and other variables only comes as an extra bonus. Even for the digital screen display that most modern espresso machines have.\n\nIn your example, Breville aka Sage has been around long enough that their espresso machine is already well regarded by industry professional as a machine for home use. As for the Krups model, you can see it is made up of plastic entirely for its exterior and it is actually a superautomatic bean-to-cup machine. It is a different category than the Breville Barista Express. Superautomatic espresso machines cater to those people who just wants their coffee in a push of a button. No hassle, it's convenient, easy to use, one touch system. Most superautomatics are also cheaper since they dont use a boiler system but rather a heat exchange or a thermoblock system which is cheaper but not that reliable in the long run. \n\nThough there are superautomatics that are costly too like the Eversys brand, but it still goes down to how their machine was built, what is it made up of, and how consistent it can produce coffee cup every cup every minute every hour.",

They are literally the worst coffee beans I have ever made coffee from.  \n  \nI’ve tried different grinds from espresso (in the aeropress) to coarse. I’ve used the aeropress, french press and a V60 pourover. The coffee tastes sour. I read up on sour/bitter confusion to make sure it actually was sour. If I add milk, it tastes like spoiled milk in shitty coffee. Adding sugar doesn’t fix it either.  \n  \nThe beans are supposed to be a medium roast. They are unevenly roasted. Some are light, some are very very dark and the rest are anywhere in between.  \n  \nI want to tell them that their coffee beans are bad but I also don’t want to rock the boat with my wife’s new job.

What I'm thinking right now is to get a good grinder first, and good enough espresso machine just to see whether I want to invest more in the future.\n\nGrinder: Timemore 078s.\n- Aesthetic is a big factor for me 😅\n- Good enough for both expresso and pour over. \n- I'm not a fan of grinder with bellow. So a lot of models are not included with this criteria alone. DF 64, Eureka Mignon. \n- Other alternatives I might be considering is Fellow Opus, or Niche Zero.\n- Not planning to go too much higher than current pricing bracket as it'll be my first purchase. And I'm not from US/EU. Even $100 translates to a considerable big amount of money in my country.\n- I'm aware that Timemore have it's own issues. But I did read great reviews too. It's a gamble in a way, I guess.\n\nEspresso machine: Delongi ECP 3420.\n- Overall seems cheap and good enough.\n\nMy question is whether this is a good plan?

Many people might be familiar with Monsooned Malabar, a completely different animal, which you can forget right now. This is not that.\n\nGrown on one of Indias premier Estates, Ratnagiri is Rainforest Alliance certified. There are three layers of shade cover, slowing coffee growth and boosting flavor, but also providing a habitat for 50 kinds of birds, as well as monkeys, boar, tigers, leopards, mongoose, and elephants. The area is a Unesco World Heritage site, as well as the birthplace of Indian coffee, and Ratnagiri Estate is serious about preserving the ecology, while producing excellent coffee.\n\nThis coffee is anaerobically processed: after an 84 hour extended fermentation in stainless tanks, the coffee is placed on raised beds and naturally slow-dried over 27 days. \n\nSo what do we get? For sure, notes of quality dark chocolate and roasted peanuts, but it's the berry compote, Pom juice, and ripe papaya fruit notes, with exotic spices like cardamom, nutmeg, maybe even patchouli, or mulled rum, that truly make this coffee unique. Great for drip methods and excellent for espresso!\n\n\n\n\n'reddit' is the code for 15% off sitewide! \n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.westcoastroasting.com/limited-edition/",

    "text": "Coffee Noob: replicating Starbucks Canned Espresso Light.\n\nI'm 33 years old and somehow I've gotten through life so far without drinking coffee. Like the smell but was never big on the taste.\n\nI have night owl tendencies, so generally I don't feel productive at work until the PM hours. I thought I'd give coffee another try to help me wake up faster. I picked up some Starbucks canned espresso with light cream and actually enjoyed the taste. Hard to say if the caffeine had an effect. I don't think it helped me feel more awake, but I think it got rid of some of the morning grogginess.\n\nI could just keep buying these but I'd rather opt for a cheaper bulk option. I did some searching and came across 'cold brew'. Supposedly this method results in less acidity, less bitterness, and more caffeine. So I bought Starbucks cold brew concentrate. The instructions say mix 180mL with 180 mL water. I used 180 mL milk instead. It's not as good as the canned espresso. Aftertaste is still too bitter for my liking. Maybe I need to use whole milk instead of 1%? Then I added 5g of sugar, the same amount as in the espresso. Still didn't taste as good, which makes sense because the sugar is less diluted in the espresso.\n\nThen I looked into the brewing method for the espresso. Apparently it is brewed using the ristretto method. Maybe the better taste is because of this?\n\nAny suggestions on how to replicate this flavor at home? Or is there no other way than to add more sugar and cream? Do I need an espresso machine?",

A local specialty shop did a B&W \"drop\" a couple of weeks ago and I had to get the internet coffee to see what everyone was on about. I didn't notice a roast date anywhere, but I gave it two weeks and I'm willing to bet it had taken two or three weeks to get to me too.\n\n\nFirst attempts were 15/16:1 with a bit of a range of grinds to try dial it in. I think I was looking for something that wasn't there, people were so excited about this coffee a while back and I had gotten the impression it was a bolder coffee than it is. I personally wouldn't call this funky, it's a bit hoppy for sure but very clean. Where this really shone for me was when I moved to espresso, particularly espresso tonics, the botanical and citrus hits taste great in that.\n\n\nIt's a nice coffee, not as vibrant as other Wilton Benitez beans I've had. I don't regret picking it up but it is a reminder that a lot of people raving about something on the internet just means it's something that's very accessable to a lot of people and has broad appeal.

Some cafes do have a single-origin espresso offering, but that hopper isn't going to filled with a gesha that sells for $8-$10+ per cup.  They would be single-dosing it and likely grinding it on the same grinder they use for their batch brew coffees, and those grinders are not always set up and capable of consistently brewing good espresso.\n\nSo, it's entirely possible that a cafe could be serving a natural Panama gesha as espresso but it's not as simple as picking one of many coffees on the menu and requesting it as an espresso.",

The biggest issue is that if you batch brew something as dense as Cometeer coffee e.g. 15 grams of coffee in, 25 grams of brew out, you'll lose 20-25 grams of brew into the coffee grounds expanding (even after pressing them with something like Aeropress). I believe espresso loses less by keeping the grounds under pressure but it's not a batch brew. \n\nBased on their patent, Cometeer deal with this by using a centrifuge to extract all the brew from the grounds. I occasionally make espressos in a batch and freeze them in silicone containers in the freezer for an americano later, the results are tasty. But it takes too much time.

There is also bored cow which is a fermented sugar milk, fermented into whey, so it’s very similar to milk. Also, there are recipes online of making barista friendly plant milks that foam well.\n\nI actually relate to this a lot because my cholesterol got high and I was not even eating that much meat, but I was having full fat dairy milk coffee every day and then I decided I wanted to go vegan but the last thing that I gave up that was hard for me to give up was dairy based lattes and cappuccinos. However, now I don’t even miss it, you just have to explore the different options and accept that oat milk is gonna have a different flavor, so are all these different nut milks. And it’s not a bad flavor, it’s the flavor of plants, it’s the flavor of nuts, nuts, have a certain sweetness, but they also have a certain bitterness. And coffee itself, is a bitter seed. So it’s not a crazy flavor to get used to, it’s just an adjustment. I remember when I first tasted coffee when I was a kid. I thought it tasted absolutely disgusting.",

    "text": "WDT in my experience definitely makes a difference in puck prep and extraction and is very consistent. I've had no luck with just tapping the side, but it DOES help to tap the bottom of the portafilter on the counter or hard surface to settle the grounds so I do that regardless. I don't own a shaker so I can't comment on that but I do use the catch cup from my grinder to shake the grounds into the portafilter.\n\nWhen I don't feel like using a WDT and funnel I just use the side of my finger to sweep everything flat like an old school barista, and then I use one of the spinny distribution tools like the OCD to flatten everything. If done correctly you should have things decently distributed in the bottom/middle of the basket from tapping and a sweep, and then the tool just takes care of the top layer without any compression.\n\nSelf leveling tampers are great because they take out some of the human variables by making sure you always tamp level so I'm cool with those. People will argue about tamping pressure but test have shown that anything over \\~20 pounds  doesn't matter, you just need to tamp hard enough that the grounds are fully compacted \"when you feel like you can't press any harder\" and you're good. What's important is that you're tamping straight and evenly.\n\nIMO a lot of these techniques are really just different ways to achieve the same thing, so just stick with the one that works best for you, The important part here is to be *consistent.*",

    "text": "Coffee Noob: replicating Starbucks Canned Espresso Light.\n\nI'm 33 years old and somehow I've gotten through life so far without drinking coffee. Like the smell but was never big on the taste.\n\nI have night owl tendencies, so generally I don't feel productive at work until the PM hours. I thought I'd give coffee another try to help me wake up faster. I picked up some Starbucks canned espresso with light cream and actually enjoyed the taste. Hard to say if the caffeine had an effect. I don't think it helped me feel more awake, but I think it got rid of some of the morning grogginess.\n\nI could just keep buying these but I'd rather opt for a cheaper bulk option. I did some searching and came across 'cold brew'. Supposedly this method results in less acidity, less bitterness, and more caffeine. So I bought Starbucks cold brew concentrate. The instructions say mix 180mL with 180 mL water. I used 180 mL milk instead. It's not as good as the canned espresso. Aftertaste is still too bitter for my liking. Maybe I need to use whole milk instead of 1%? Then I added 5g of sugar, the same amount as in the espresso. Still didn't taste as good, which makes sense because the sugar is less diluted in the espresso.\n\nThen I looked into the brewing method for the espresso. Apparently it is brewed using the ristretto method. Maybe the better taste is because of this?\n\nAny suggestions on how to replicate this flavor at home? Or is there no other way than to add more sugar and cream? Do I need an espresso machine?",

Get yourself a log book to track your settings so you can repeat them and dial things in quickly.\n\nI've also got a Bambino Plus which is an often suggested starter machine.... it's fine for milk drinks, and has a decent automated milk steamer.

Nothing I did was unusual, and I even opened a fresh carton of coffee cream today, and both my wife and I tasted it and it was decent. \n\nThe only thing o can think of is either there was a moldy seed in the mix, or I added really hot water. But don’t recall being too impatient today. I usually let the water sit for a minute before adding it to the French press.\n\nAnyway, about that flavour, first time I noticed it was in Mexico at an all inclusive resort about 20 years ago, specifically in the tomatoes. I’ve only experienced that once again since, in a tomato salsa from a taco stand, and now a third time today in my coffee. I can only assume it’s some kind of mold?\n\nAnyway, made a new coffee and all is well. Just can’t shake that nasty flavour.",

At some point the guy of the shop pointed me to the Ceado E6C as a premium single dose grinder. Honestly I have never heard of them and was curious. He was offering me it for 850€ which seems to be indeed a fair deal. But so far I was not able to find good comparable shops which are selling this grinder in Germany.\n\nDoes anyone have experience or thoughts about this company and especially their single dose E6C Modell. I was not able to find much info about it.\n\nMy main usage should be actually French press, filter and portafilter.\n\nMy current main questions are:\n\n- Are their self made 64 flat burs any good and worth?\n- what about the retention?\n- how is the support and maintenance, as I was not seeing anyone selling it online either the grinder or accessories nor the burs\n- what should be a normal reasonable good price?\n\nAlso maybe some thoughts that it looks quite similar to the DF64 models is there any relation?\n\nThank you in advance!",

    "text": "Question regarding mechanical coffee scales😸\n\nI'm currently looking for a good mechanical scale that I can use for weighing my coffee. Either new or something I'll need to hunt for in antique shops. I'm fully aware a little battery operated scale will serve my needs perfectly. I will get one eventually for travel and convenience but hopefully you'll hear me out first \n\nMy coffee set-up as it is so far is completely manual. \n\nIt consists of my 1950s mug, 1920s Spong & Co No.1 coffee grinder, my Great Grandmothers percolator she gifted me, and several other older kitchen appliances. \n\nI also have a medium sized Birchleaf coffee grinder (Looks exactly like the full sized ones you would see in the early 18th century in grocery stores), London pottery coffee grinder, Moka pot, a few other percolators of various brands, Chemex, and a portable manual pump expesso brewer. Several of these are gifts as well (Likely because I enjoy making everyone coffee)\n\nI love doing stuff manually because it brings me closer to what I'm working with and I find it rather peaceful/relaxing. I could say more but I already risk coming across as a coffee snob as it is.😹\n\nI'm very new to weighing my coffee and have been using the \"Well it looks good enough\" or measuring scoop method. So I'm hoping to up my coffee game \n\nAll the videos I've watched on YouTube or read about when it comes to learning how to weight coffee always uses a digital scale. There's not really much information out there for manual mechanical scales and coffee. \n\nI've considered using several other larger scales but I think it's possible they'd be overkill. I wouldn't mind a large scale but something at least wealdy to bring out when I make coffee would be nice. Something like a Taylor Kitchen scale perhaps?\n\nThe TLDR version of this is I think an automatic digital coffee scale will throw off my set-up and mess up my shelf appeal as of right now. \n\nThank you to anyone who even took the time to read this 😸\n\nEdit: I have no budget",

    "text": "I've spent a fair amount of time researching this topic. The biggest issue is that if you batch brew something as dense as Cometeer coffee e.g. 15 grams of coffee in, 25 grams of brew out, you'll lose 20-25 grams of brew into the coffee grounds expanding (even after pressing them with something like Aeropress). I believe espresso loses less by keeping the grounds under pressure but it's not a batch brew. \n\nBased on their patent, Cometeer deal with this by using a centrifuge to extract all the brew from the grounds. I occasionally make espressos in a batch and freeze them in silicone containers in the freezer for an americano later, the results are tasty. But it takes too much time. I mainly keep buying Cometeer. It's expensive but well-deserved imo given how hard it is to replicate at home.",

Pay attention to how you dispose of the grounds, which can be especially offensive. A mini diaper pail or similar might be the best way to handle that if you have to have your coffee area in the main living area.

    "text": "TLDR:   K.I.S.S.\n\nI replicate my brews just fine,  thank you. You're invited to my house to try a couple,  back to back. Don't think you can judge from afar.\n\nEven Lance Hedrick says getting to 80% of the potential is good enough,  in most cases. But see the video for full context.\n\nI use these technique(s), successfully with the Tsubami, the B75, the V60, the Mugen,  and the Hario Switch. \n\nThe Switch is an exception. I use the Coffee Chronicler recipe without deviation because it's delicious and stupid simple. But I have dumped coffee into the switch for 5 minutes and got delicious coffee. That is a great option some mornings. Also easily replicated. Like the Aeropress, it's hard to screw up coffee with the Switch.\n\nI get more consistent results using pulse pouring or bloom +2 pours  than I do with fiddly and faffy timed, 4 or 5 pour recipes. And I don't believe the coffee in the cup is a single point better pouring for 15 seconds or 20 seconds or some other seemingly arbitrary time, multiple times.\n\nAdmittedly, it may be my technique is lacking or maybe you could get tastier cups. But my pourovers are at least one grade level higher, for my tastes, than those poured by my nearest specialty  coffee shop professionals.\n\nI can also transfer these techniques  easily to new brewers.\n\nCoincidentally, I brewed 8 g with the Deep 27 for the first time today and the coffee was out of the park. So was the second cup. Credit to RogueWave for the beans, Cafec  for design and filters and the DF54 Grinder. And the filter in my fridge.\n\nAll this doesn't mean I won't chase a better cup with grind, ratio, temp, water, or agitation. But it won't usually involve a stop watch.\n\nBottom Line,: Sometimes I want to experiment carefully and push the possibilities, cup the differences and make note for the future. \n\nMost times  I just want to make a \"damn fine cup of coffee\", with the least hassle possible.\n\nBut I do me and you do you. (Why does that sound...yucky)\n\nThanks for the input. \n\nPax",

Now I'm experimenting with Cafec Abaca conical filters to see how those compare and when I might choose the flat-bottom filters vs conical filters.

The Origami encourages experimentation with both filter styles, so I feel it's a more-versatile brewer than some of the others out there.  Plus, it just looks amazing.\n\nThere's an aspect of pouring technique that comes into play, but the brewers and filters can influence flow rate and the amount of bypass around the grounds.  And those can have a big impact on flavor profiles, as well.\n\nI guess it depends on how much you enjoy the tinkering aspect of your coffee experience.  For me, tinkering and experimenting are my jam, so I love versatility and novelty.  For example, I have my eyes set on the Melodrip Colum dripper as my next brewer.

The dose of the Cafflano should be about 10g, so yeah a third less coffee but with the grind size difference I would think you are doing more work in the end. Yeah the Rhinowares one looks just like my knockoff Porlex. It was night and day when I made the transition. I switch coffees fairly regularly (coffee roaster), It was always a pain dialing it in because it was always left to chance. The Comandante is not perfect but it is fairly repeatable. I have a log book of different coffees and how many “clicks” it took to get the desired result, as well as what the dose was, how it was roasted, and water temp during brewing. When I come back around to the same, or similar, coffee I have a starting point. This helps a lot when switching between filter and espresso.\n\nAlso I never quite felt like I ever got the old grinder clean. I dislike ceramic grinders because they hold onto the oil. The Comandante is stainless so its easy to clean. \n\nI don’t say any of this to imply you need to upgrade. I had the Hario Skerton for years, back when I only had the Aeropress. This duo worked for 5 or so years, before I felt the need to upgrade. I work a couple of days a week as a Barista and I get tips.

I really like the aftertaste it leaves a very pleasant mouthfeel. I think it will open up more I am still on the early side.\n\n**Subtext Daniel Caro Washed Chiroso** \\- Similar vibe to the last couple mejorados I have been trying.

This may be the first time I have not gotten anything resembling the notes on the bag from Subtext. They note cola, red apple, and blue fruit. My cups have been pretty hollow and woody/green tasting. I am hoping if I let it rest longer I get something more enjoyable.

I let it rest for 2 months and I still don't enjoy it. The only way I found it somewhat enjoyable was blending it with other coffee. I get a pretty bitter aftertaste and of course notes of lychee.\n\n**S&W Rwanda Dukorere Kawa Bukure Natural** \\- This one was pretty decent, not quite up to the standard of kenyas and natural ethiopias I have gotten from S&W.

Ever since I started making adult money (😅) and invested in coffee, I’ve been thoroughly enjoying exploring East Africa beans. It’s been an amazing journey to say the least and now I’d like to start exploring coffee from other regions (definitely keeping my eye out for Colombia and Guatemala beans)",

    "text": "**Subtext Raquel Lasso Washed Gesha** \\- Unlike any washed gesha I have tried. First cup I was hit in the face with sweet tropical fruit but very little acidity. Second cup was more acid forward and I got more raspberry notes which I enjoyed more. It honestly tastes more like a natural process than a washed process bean. I really like the aftertaste it leaves a very pleasant mouthfeel. I think it will open up more I am still on the early side.\n\n**Subtext Daniel Caro Washed Chiroso** \\- Similar vibe to the last couple mejorados I have been trying. Dates and stone fruit is mostly what I get. I love this cup profile. If the rest of my daily cups could just taste like this bag I would be happy. It has been very easy to brew and lovely.\n\n**Subtext Sebastian Garces Washed Enepei** \\- Never heard of this varietal before, not sure it is even technically a true varietal yet. This may be the first time I have not gotten anything resembling the notes on the bag from Subtext. They note cola, red apple, and blue fruit. My cups have been pretty hollow and woody/green tasting. I am hoping if I let it rest longer I get something more enjoyable. My first real miss after trying 8+ bags of Subtext.\n\nI still think their reserve subscription is the best subscription I have tried for the price and I am bummed I am skipping next month after I saw what they are offering.\n\n**S&W Colombia Santa Monica Lychee Coferment** \\- I kinda knew going into it that I would not like this coffee. I let it rest for 2 months and I still don't enjoy it. The only way I found it somewhat enjoyable was blending it with other coffee. I get a pretty bitter aftertaste and of course notes of lychee.\n\n**S&W Rwanda Dukorere Kawa Bukure Natural** \\- This one was pretty decent, not quite up to the standard of kenyas and natural ethiopias I have gotten from S&W. Which was kinda to be expected but I like trying other countries in africa. I have had good cups from Burundi, Congo, and Uganda. I noted plum and black tea notes. Was hoping for more berry/stone fruit, but the acidity/tartness wasn't coming through for me.",

    "text": "Totally true about those \"ungodly great beans\" - I've found the best way to discover them is actually keeping a really basic log of what you liked and why. After blowing too much cash on fancy beans that didnt click with me, I started writing batch numbers and origins down with quick notes like \"fruity\" or \"chocolate bomb\" or just \"meh\". Now I kinda know what regions I prefer for espresso (Ethiopia and Colombia usually slap) and which roasters nail my preferred profile. Water quality matters almost as much tho - when i moved apartments my exact same bean setup suddenly tasted totally different until I started filtering.",
