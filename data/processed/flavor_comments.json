    "text": "Coffee Noob: replicating Starbucks Canned Espresso Light.\n\nI'm 33 years old and somehow I've gotten through life so far without drinking coffee. Like the smell but was never big on the taste.\n\nI have night owl tendencies, so generally I don't feel productive at work until the PM hours. I thought I'd give coffee another try to help me wake up faster. I picked up some Starbucks canned espresso with light cream and actually enjoyed the taste. Hard to say if the caffeine had an effect. I don't think it helped me feel more awake, but I think it got rid of some of the morning grogginess.\n\nI could just keep buying these but I'd rather opt for a cheaper bulk option. I did some searching and came across 'cold brew'. Supposedly this method results in less acidity, less bitterness, and more caffeine. So I bought Starbucks cold brew concentrate. The instructions say mix 180mL with 180 mL water. I used 180 mL milk instead. It's not as good as the canned espresso. Aftertaste is still too bitter for my liking. Maybe I need to use whole milk instead of 1%? Then I added 5g of sugar, the same amount as in the espresso. Still didn't taste as good, which makes sense because the sugar is less diluted in the espresso.\n\nThen I looked into the brewing method for the espresso. Apparently it is brewed using the ristretto method. Maybe the better taste is because of this?\n\nAny suggestions on how to replicate this flavor at home? Or is there no other way than to add more sugar and cream? Do I need an espresso machine?",

Second cup was more acid forward and I got more raspberry notes which I enjoyed more. It honestly tastes more like a natural process than a washed process bean. I really like the aftertaste it leaves a very pleasant mouthfeel. I think it will open up more I am still on the early side.\n\n**Subtext Daniel Caro Washed Chiroso** \\- Similar vibe to the last couple mejorados I have been trying. Dates and stone fruit is mostly what I get. I love this cup profile. If the rest of my daily cups could just taste like this bag I would be happy. It has been very easy to brew and lovely.\n\n**Subtext Sebastian Garces Washed Enepei** \\- Never heard of this varietal before, not sure it is even technically a true varietal yet. This may be the first time I have not gotten anything resembling the notes on the bag from Subtext. They note cola, red apple, and blue fruit. My cups have been pretty hollow and woody/green tasting. I am hoping if I let it rest longer I get something more enjoyable. My first real miss after trying 8+ bags of Subtext.\n\nI still think their reserve subscription is the best subscription I have tried for the price and I am bummed I am skipping next month after I saw what they are offering.\n\n**S&W Colombia Santa Monica Lychee Coferment** \\- I kinda knew going into it that I would not like this coffee. I let it rest for 2 months and I still don't enjoy it. The only way I found it somewhat enjoyable was blending it with other coffee. I get a pretty bitter aftertaste and of course notes of lychee.\n\n**S&W Rwanda Dukorere Kawa Bukure Natural** \\- This one was pretty decent, not quite up to the standard of kenyas and natural ethiopias I have gotten from S&W. Which was kinda to be expected but I like trying other countries in africa. I have had good cups from Burundi, Congo, and Uganda. I noted plum and black tea notes. Was hoping for more berry/stone fruit, but the acidity/tartness wasn't coming through for me.",

Percolators are easy to get wrong.  You need to pay attention to perk time from the beginning of water appearing in the knob.  Different people like different spans.  Also, the rate of percolation is critical.  At a rolling boil, the water is too hot.  On a gas stove, I run the burner just a little above low and time the process from when it first starts to actually perk, not the first time water appears in the bulb, but a few seconds later when it starts repeating.  Up to that point, the heat is on high.  I turn the gas down to \\_near\\_ low and let it go.  Once my preferred cooking time is up, I pull it off the heat.  While many like to keep their coffee warm somehow, this gradually makes the coffee increasingly bitter.  My parents used to keep the pot warm on the stove on the smallest gas burner.  That creates a corrosively bitter, acidic coffee, drinkable only with lots of cream and sugar, and I prefer either black or just a little added milk.  I find it easier to just reheat the coffee by the cup in a microwave or on the stove in a small sauce pan.",

    "text": "Yes. Number 1 is good beans. If they have a \"best before\" date then they aren't good beans. When you buy them from a good roaster they will have a date for when they were roasted. You want to use them 2 weeks after roasting and usually within a month after that. Check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9YnLFrM7Fs. This explains why grocery store coffee is cheap but not great. \n\nThe number 2 is grind consistency. If you are using a blade grinder, the size of the grind won't be consistent. Some grains will be larger, some will be smaller. This means some will extract more be bitter, some will extract less and be sour. If they are all the same size, you can adjust grind size to be not too small (bitter) and not too large (sour).\n\nAfter these two things, you are getting really small improvements. My two biggest investments were good beans and a really nice hand grinder. I was lucky to find a good hand grinder for $100 CDN but anything comparable is probably around $200 CDN. My current hand grinder is now $200 CDN.",

    "text": "You're not getting upvoted because you're posting in a subreddit about coffee that has crawled up its own ass and died.  Also, you might be right about needing to educate your palate.\n\nThere are definitely grades of coffee beans and anyone who has taken whole beans from Trader Joe's and ground them at home then tried grinding a comparable roast of Starbucks can tell there's a difference.  The Trader Joe's tastes nice, but there's a hollowness.  Starbucks is going to be richer.  The two companies use different grades of beans and it is perceptible. If you taste no difference between cheap supermarket coffee and fresh ground high-end stuff, I suspect you might need to try more coffee.\n\nEven so, my view is that one quickly reaches the point of diminishing returns when paying for coffee.  I think the same is true for wine.  I mean, a $200 bottle of wine might be noticeably nicer than a $50 bottle, bur a lot of people make the decision that it's not worth the extra $150.  With coffee I think the ceiling is lower.  No matter what you do, there are some bitter compounds in coffee and it is acidic.  Taste-wise, I usually feel it's pleasant at best.  I don't think I've ever had a cup of black coffee - and I drink several most days - that I thought was delicious.  It's fine. I like it. Would I call it delicious? No.\n\nIt smells great, it's a pleasant stimulant, it tastes fine - and at the end of the day, maybe the taste and smell differences between Trader Joe's and Starbucks coffee isn't worth five dollars a pound.   I like Starbucks better and I'm still trying to decide where the ceiling is for me.  Honestly, probably not much higher than that",

    "text": "Yes and no. Price and quality correlate but it's not necessarily a causal relationship.\n\n\nFirst off most people here are not from coffee producing countries, for our coffee to be cheap it needs to be intensively farmed robusta where nobody involved in producing it was paid very much, this is as it costs a lot to get here, cheap coffees will then be blended when they get here for uniformity so there is no defining origin. I've tasted mexican supermarket coffee and while it's not the most subtle roast it's very fresh arabica from a specific region in the country and does have a flavour profile reflective of that, though it is masked by the roast quality. I would imagine if I went to Mexico with a €14 250g bag of speciality roast from the same region they would think I'm insane, the improvement wouldn't be worth that much of a jump in price. By the time that coffee gets here that's just what it costs though, and that's a very basic coffee of a productive varietal with no major processing.\n\n\nWith that in mind there are those additional factors of variety, processing, and roasting that add both cost and value. Those are carefully managed in speciality coffee. An internationally respected roaster in Colombia is [Amor Perfecto](https://cafeamorperfecto.com/) if you want to try something externally verified to see if it's for you. The fact is there are more people branding and pricing themselves as producing specialty coffee than are actually producing it, so sometimes you are just paying more for very little improvement. I try to taste things or get a recommendation before buying from somewhere new because of this.\n\n\nAssuming none of this is relevant and your coffee is well produced and roasted,  it is possible you're doing something to not get the best out of it. If it's very freshly roasted it might need to rest a week or two to taste of much for example. It's possible you've always brewed your coffee to a point of bitterness where it's no longer easy to differentiate tastes. Or maybe your grinder isn't up to the task. As you already have the coffee I'd suggest try cupping it to see if there's anything you might be missing in the preparation.",

This is because despite reasonable ppm, Volvic doesn't have a lot of Mg and Ca. The theory says this'll reduce your extraction to some extent (I think we're still missing papers though). For darker roasts I doubt that's a huge issue though.\n\n\nThe KH sits almost squarely at the lower end of the same water recipes. The higher your KH, the more of your aromatic acids in your coffee will be reduced. For darker roasts, you typically don't want as much GH and your water is actually already in a popular range for this!\n\n\nI would guess that your water is already in a pretty good spot for the types of beans that you brew.\nIf you are ever interested in lighter roasts (though I gather you don't really like them), I would go up both in GH and KH.\n\n\nYou can mix your volvic with distilled water, which will reduce both extraction and leave more acidity in your cup, which may balance out the bitterness, but that would already be a fairly unconventional brew water for espresso.

At the 4:00 mark, break the crust by passing the spoon through the cupping bowl all the way to the bottom, 3 times. Then let them cool until around 8-10m when they’re cool enough to start tasting.\n\nCup blind - label the bowls on the bottom but try not to think about what you’re tasting. 4 coffees per cupping is a good starting point; more than that is hard to keep track of. Try for some contrast.\n\nTake notes. Don’t feel bound to use a scoresheet, but write a few words for each coffee as you’re tasting. Try going down the line tasting only for acidity, or bitterness, or sweetness - jot down something about each bowl, even if it’s just “more than #2” or “ew.”\n\nDon’t judge right away. You will inevitably start tasting when things are a little too hot, and almost every coffee will improve as it cools to body temperature. Often I’ve made the mistake of writing off a bowl at the start only to find that it opens up into a floral bouquet or a delicate acidity later on.\n\nWhatever you do, don’t vary your protocol between bowls, or between cupping sessions - at least until you’ve done a few. The whole point is to standardize the brewing method to let the differences in the coffees shine through.",

If your grind size is more uniform, you will actually taste what the coffee is supposed to taste like once dialed in. The flavors will separate and you can pick out what those flavors are.

Classic Italian espresso is usually made from a blend of both Arabica and Robusta coffee, with a ratio of around 60/40. Arabica coffee is not great at producing crema and can be a bit thin. In contrast, Robusta coffee is great at producing crema, but can be too bitter for some, though it has more caffeine than Arabica.\n\nVietnamese coffee is 100% Robusta. I got my hands on a Phin filter, after going to a Vietnamese restaurant. I fell in love with the full bodied Smokey flavor. In Vietnam the government invested in the research and development of the Robusta coffee sector. It's hearty, insect resistance, and faster maturation as apposed to Arabica was an easy win. Vietnam grows about 40% of the worlds Robusta coffee. The history of how Vietnam became a world coffee producer is super interesting. I'll link a video does a good idea of explaining the key points. \n\nI roast an India Parchment Peaberry Robusta at work. It's a beautiful coffee, and is a bestseller at the cafe's. We recommend it when someone says they want strong coffee, or they need a pick-me-up(more caffeine). Because Robusta is less expensive, we often sell out, so the demand is high. As espresso pulls beautifully 1cm of long standing crema easy. It looks a amazing when pulled into a glass espresso cup, it has these three distinct layers/bands. It just takes super long time to properly dial in so we only have it on the machine maybe once a season, and only if I'm working it.",

I recently tried a three hole wand tip but went back to the single hole because I got better results. The secret is to get the wand submerged quickly without making any large bubbles and then get to that sweet spot where it is hissing and expanding while swirling at high speed. This gives me plenty of creamy micro foam and ends up looking like white paint. If you do get any large bubbles, banging the pitcher will help break them up. 👍🏼",

Then let them cool until around 8-10m when they’re cool enough to start tasting.\n\nCup blind - label the bowls on the bottom but try not to think about what you’re tasting. 4 coffees per cupping is a good starting point; more than that is hard to keep track of. Try for some contrast.\n\nTake notes. Don’t feel bound to use a scoresheet, but write a few words for each coffee as you’re tasting. Try going down the line tasting only for acidity, or bitterness, or sweetness - jot down something about each bowl, even if it’s just “more than #2” or “ew.”\n\nDon’t judge right away.

And the trouble with coffee that doesn't have a super well developed roast (medium, or medium-dark, depending on roaster; still before second crack) is that it doesn't stand up to milk well.\n\nNow there are people that are accustomed to first wave/diner coffee, and they want it like their little ceasars pizza, hot and ready. I have a family member that falls into the latter category, and while I can get her to try different lighter roast coffees, she generally likes the temperature of her cup to be much hotter than would allow more of the vibrant flavor notes to present. When someone drinks their coffee hot enough to dull any terroir nuance (as an extreme example) the best you can do is a developed roast that they complement as 'smooth'.\n\nI applaud the attempt at finding common ground, but not if it results in both needing to compromise their preferences; there is a reason 'his/her' is more than just a stereotype/meme.

Based on that, I started opening them at 3-4 weeks off-roast, and consuming them over the next month, so maybe up until 7-8 weeks off-roast. I always felt like 6 weeks was kind of the sweet spot, but at the same time, can't say there was much discernible drop-off going a couple of weeks beyond that. It's nice to ride the wave of changing flavours over the course of that month.\n\nThis is all anecdotal, of course. How many bags do you have at that moment and how much do you consume per day? In my opinion, freezing coffee is worthwhile only under certain circumstances (you purchase more than one of the same bag, you want to save a few single doses of a special coffee, or you seriously over-purchased). Keeping a coffee to consume within a 1-2 week period because you're afraid of a major drop-off isn't even worth considering if you're drinking light-roasted coffee.

Like the smell but was never big on the taste.\n\nI have night owl tendencies, so generally I don't feel productive at work until the PM hours. I thought I'd give coffee another try to help me wake up faster. I picked up some Starbucks canned espresso with light cream and actually enjoyed the taste. Hard to say if the caffeine had an effect. I don't think it helped me feel more awake, but I think it got rid of some of the morning grogginess.\n\nI could just keep buying these but I'd rather opt for a cheaper bulk option. I did some searching and came across 'cold brew'. Supposedly this method results in less acidity, less bitterness, and more caffeine. So I bought Starbucks cold brew concentrate. The instructions say mix 180mL with 180 mL water. I used 180 mL milk instead. It's not as good as the canned espresso. Aftertaste is still too bitter for my liking. Maybe I need to use whole milk instead of 1%? Then I added 5g of sugar, the same amount as in the espresso. Still didn't taste as good, which makes sense because the sugar is less diluted in the espresso.\n\nThen I looked into the brewing method for the espresso. Apparently it is brewed using the ristretto method. Maybe the better taste is because of this?\n\nAny suggestions on how to replicate this flavor at home? Or is there no other way than to add more sugar and cream? Do I need an espresso machine?",

I have recently done some reading about the different flavor profiles that can be achieved depending on whether you use a flat bottomed (Kalita) or conical(v60) pour-over and I found that the science matched my experience? The flat bottomed tends to give more body and the conical more acidity and floral… so, that might be a thing to consider?\n\nI have had various subscriptions through the years. To name a few: Verve (superb), Elm Roasters (delish!!), Loveless (dynamite), and most-recently SEY!

That’s not what happens in the Philos. You need to dump like 30 g of beans at a time to cause a bottle neck and regrinding.

But what’s the purpose other than another way to get a different particle distribution that can be achieved by a different burr set. \n\nAs the OP discovered slow feeding changes things to the point where you can’t get grinds that extract properly even with the lowest setting. \n\nI really don’t see the point of it other than for experimentation.  There are multiple parameters that can be changed to sisal down acidity and bring out flavor notes, extraction time, temperature, pressure and  flow profiling before I’d consider feeding one bean at a time to a grinder.",

This is because despite reasonable ppm, Volvic doesn't have a lot of Mg and Ca. The theory says this'll reduce your extraction to some extent (I think we're still missing papers though). For darker roasts I doubt that's a huge issue though.\n\n\nThe KH sits almost squarely at the lower end of the same water recipes. The higher your KH, the more of your aromatic acids in your coffee will be reduced. For darker roasts, you typically don't want as much GH and your water is actually already in a popular range for this!\n\n\nI would guess that your water is already in a pretty good spot for the types of beans that you brew.\nIf you are ever interested in lighter roasts (though I gather you don't really like them), I would go up both in GH and KH.\n\n\nYou can mix your volvic with distilled water, which will reduce both extraction and leave more acidity in your cup, which may balance out the bitterness, but that would already be a fairly unconventional brew water for espresso.

This particular India Robusta is only peaberries, and has this syrupy consistency and a smoky/ sweet flavor, no acidity.

Acidity is still not quite there.\n- [Maria Delgado (Colombian Caturra)](https://www.subtext.coffee/collections/filter-coffee-beans/products/colombia-maria-delgado-washed-caturra): very juicy and \"nostalgic\" washed Colombian profile, which a classic malic warmth in finish. Unapologetically fruity.\n- [Alirio Ortega (Colombian Pacamara)](https://www.subtext.coffee/collections/filter-coffee-beans/products/alirio-munoz-ortega-washed-pacamara): also juicy, though a bit fresher and underdeveloped.\n- **Sebastian Garces (Ecuadorian Enepei)**: still dialing in this one — it exhibits some of those less desirable roasty/earthy qualities I've occasionally experienced from Ecuadorian coffees. Hopefully I'll get it right soon!\n\nI think I'm finally learning that 1) I'm not *generally* a huge fan of geshas (too delicate) and 2) I'm not the biggest fan of Ecuadorian coffees (with exceptions) and 3) \"boring\" washed Colombian coffees rarely disappoint me (because they're juicy and vibrant) :D",

When I say that sweet notes work better with milk than acidic ones they always change their mind.",

I worked at a high end Italian place for 11 years and went through about four machines ranging from full manual to seventeen thousand dollar automatic machines. I make a cappuccino every day and I use 50/50 half and half and low-fat lactose free milk on a Barista Express. I recently tried a three hole wand tip but went back to the single hole because I got better results. The secret is to get the wand submerged quickly without making any large bubbles and then get to that sweet spot where it is hissing and expanding while swirling at high speed. This gives me plenty of creamy micro foam and ends up looking like white paint. If you do get any large bubbles, banging the pitcher will help break them up. 👍🏼",
