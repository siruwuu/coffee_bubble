In Turkish coffee you use dark roasted arabica or robusta type of coffe beans (arabica is always better.) and grind them super fine. No additional flavors in classical Turkish coffee. Then you put a cup of cold water into the coffe pot, put one desert spoon or tea spoon of this finely ground coffee into the pot with sugar if you want and put the pot onto the slow burning stove. You wait for the coffee to sink into the water before stirring it slowly and once everything is mixed you wait for the coffe to simmer. You \"never\" \"ever\" boil Turkish coffee or you'll lose its natural foam and taste. Once the coffee starts to simmer and rise you pour it to the cup. And voila! You have an espresso like coffee with a little more body. Do not worry about the coffee grounds. Since they are super fine they quickly sink to the bottom of the cup and never spoil your taste.

This works well for Ethiopians. \n\nStalling and long draw down is almost always related to fines migrating and clogging up the filter. So, fewer pours will be better, avoiding swirls will be better and subsequent pours before the prior fully drawn down will generally be better.\n\nEdit: I pretty much use 6.0 on ode 2 for almost every brew.  Know that your Ethiopian bean will have fines, no matter the grind setting.   If you stay at 5 and do single pour, it will brew in under two minutes and will be quite well extracted for the time it took.  (I stir with chopstick when I single pour).",

    "text": "Yes and no. Price and quality correlate but it's not necessarily a causal relationship.\n\n\nFirst off most people here are not from coffee producing countries, for our coffee to be cheap it needs to be intensively farmed robusta where nobody involved in producing it was paid very much, this is as it costs a lot to get here, cheap coffees will then be blended when they get here for uniformity so there is no defining origin. I've tasted mexican supermarket coffee and while it's not the most subtle roast it's very fresh arabica from a specific region in the country and does have a flavour profile reflective of that, though it is masked by the roast quality. I would imagine if I went to Mexico with a ‚Ç¨14 250g bag of speciality roast from the same region they would think I'm insane, the improvement wouldn't be worth that much of a jump in price. By the time that coffee gets here that's just what it costs though, and that's a very basic coffee of a productive varietal with no major processing.\n\n\nWith that in mind there are those additional factors of variety, processing, and roasting that add both cost and value. Those are carefully managed in speciality coffee. An internationally respected roaster in Colombia is [Amor Perfecto](https://cafeamorperfecto.com/) if you want to try something externally verified to see if it's for you. The fact is there are more people branding and pricing themselves as producing specialty coffee than are actually producing it, so sometimes you are just paying more for very little improvement. I try to taste things or get a recommendation before buying from somewhere new because of this.\n\n\nAssuming none of this is relevant and your coffee is well produced and roasted,¬† it is possible you're doing something to not get the best out of it. If it's very freshly roasted it might need to rest a week or two to taste of much for example. It's possible you've always brewed your coffee to a point of bitterness where it's no longer easy to differentiate tastes. Or maybe your grinder isn't up to the task. As you already have the coffee I'd suggest try cupping it to see if there's anything you might be missing in the preparation.",

I went with their Love Blend to see how their daily production coffee is.  I like it in the aeropress so far and will try it pourover soon.  \n\n15 grams beans, fine-ish grind, about 4 minute inverted with 209\\* water, 40 second +/- press.\n\n\"A complex blend, offering sweet red fruits and chocolate flavors. Composed of natural-processed traditional varieties from the Panama highlands and complemented with a bright and elegant Colombian from the Tolima region.\"",

That said, I‚Äôd suggest it‚Äôs relative to the expectations of what clarity means for that specific coffee. With a thermal shock wine yeast anaerobic pink bourbon from wilton benitez, one might have a very clear sense that it tastes like strawberry yogurt and rhubarb and thereby conclude it to be a high clarity presentation of those flavors, but with a washed colombian coffee from Prodigal, clarity would present in a way that‚Äôs less based on the intensity of flavor distinction than the fleeting complexity that its lighter body allows for and makes possible",
