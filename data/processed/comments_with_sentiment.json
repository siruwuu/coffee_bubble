    "text": "Coffee Noob: replicating Starbucks Canned Espresso Light.\n\nI'm 33 years old and somehow I've gotten through life so far without drinking coffee. Like the smell but was never big on the taste.\n\nI have night owl tendencies, so generally I don't feel productive at work until the PM hours. I thought I'd give coffee another try to help me wake up faster. I picked up some Starbucks canned espresso with light cream and actually enjoyed the taste. Hard to say if the caffeine had an effect. I don't think it helped me feel more awake, but I think it got rid of some of the morning grogginess.\n\nI could just keep buying these but I'd rather opt for a cheaper bulk option. I did some searching and came across 'cold brew'. Supposedly this method results in less acidity, less bitterness, and more caffeine. So I bought Starbucks cold brew concentrate. The instructions say mix 180mL with 180 mL water. I used 180 mL milk instead. It's not as good as the canned espresso. Aftertaste is still too bitter for my liking. Maybe I need to use whole milk instead of 1%? Then I added 5g of sugar, the same amount as in the espresso. Still didn't taste as good, which makes sense because the sugar is less diluted in the espresso.\n\nThen I looked into the brewing method for the espresso. Apparently it is brewed using the ristretto method. Maybe the better taste is because of this?\n\nAny suggestions on how to replicate this flavor at home? Or is there no other way than to add more sugar and cream? Do I need an espresso machine?",

Second cup was more acid forward and I got more raspberry notes which I enjoyed more. It honestly tastes more like a natural process than a washed process bean. I really like the aftertaste it leaves a very pleasant mouthfeel. I think it will open up more I am still on the early side.\n\n**Subtext Daniel Caro Washed Chiroso** \\- Similar vibe to the last couple mejorados I have been trying. Dates and stone fruit is mostly what I get. I love this cup profile. If the rest of my daily cups could just taste like this bag I would be happy. It has been very easy to brew and lovely.\n\n**Subtext Sebastian Garces Washed Enepei** \\- Never heard of this varietal before, not sure it is even technically a true varietal yet. This may be the first time I have not gotten anything resembling the notes on the bag from Subtext. They note cola, red apple, and blue fruit. My cups have been pretty hollow and woody/green tasting. I am hoping if I let it rest longer I get something more enjoyable. My first real miss after trying 8+ bags of Subtext.\n\nI still think their reserve subscription is the best subscription I have tried for the price and I am bummed I am skipping next month after I saw what they are offering.\n\n**S&W Colombia Santa Monica Lychee Coferment** \\- I kinda knew going into it that I would not like this coffee. I let it rest for 2 months and I still don't enjoy it. The only way I found it somewhat enjoyable was blending it with other coffee. I get a pretty bitter aftertaste and of course notes of lychee.\n\n**S&W Rwanda Dukorere Kawa Bukure Natural** \\- This one was pretty decent, not quite up to the standard of kenyas and natural ethiopias I have gotten from S&W. Which was kinda to be expected but I like trying other countries in africa. I have had good cups from Burundi, Congo, and Uganda. I noted plum and black tea notes. Was hoping for more berry/stone fruit, but the acidity/tartness wasn't coming through for me.",

Percolators are easy to get wrong.  You need to pay attention to perk time from the beginning of water appearing in the knob.  Different people like different spans.  Also, the rate of percolation is critical.  At a rolling boil, the water is too hot.  On a gas stove, I run the burner just a little above low and time the process from when it first starts to actually perk, not the first time water appears in the bulb, but a few seconds later when it starts repeating.  Up to that point, the heat is on high.  I turn the gas down to \\_near\\_ low and let it go.  Once my preferred cooking time is up, I pull it off the heat.  While many like to keep their coffee warm somehow, this gradually makes the coffee increasingly bitter.  My parents used to keep the pot warm on the stove on the smallest gas burner.  That creates a corrosively bitter, acidic coffee, drinkable only with lots of cream and sugar, and I prefer either black or just a little added milk.  I find it easier to just reheat the coffee by the cup in a microwave or on the stove in a small sauce pan.",

    "text": "Yes. Number 1 is good beans. If they have a \"best before\" date then they aren't good beans. When you buy them from a good roaster they will have a date for when they were roasted. You want to use them 2 weeks after roasting and usually within a month after that. Check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9YnLFrM7Fs. This explains why grocery store coffee is cheap but not great. \n\nThe number 2 is grind consistency. If you are using a blade grinder, the size of the grind won't be consistent. Some grains will be larger, some will be smaller. This means some will extract more be bitter, some will extract less and be sour. If they are all the same size, you can adjust grind size to be not too small (bitter) and not too large (sour).\n\nAfter these two things, you are getting really small improvements. My two biggest investments were good beans and a really nice hand grinder. I was lucky to find a good hand grinder for $100 CDN but anything comparable is probably around $200 CDN. My current hand grinder is now $200 CDN.",

    "text": "You're not getting upvoted because you're posting in a subreddit about coffee that has crawled up its own ass and died.  Also, you might be right about needing to educate your palate.\n\nThere are definitely grades of coffee beans and anyone who has taken whole beans from Trader Joe's and ground them at home then tried grinding a comparable roast of Starbucks can tell there's a difference.  The Trader Joe's tastes nice, but there's a hollowness.  Starbucks is going to be richer.  The two companies use different grades of beans and it is perceptible. If you taste no difference between cheap supermarket coffee and fresh ground high-end stuff, I suspect you might need to try more coffee.\n\nEven so, my view is that one quickly reaches the point of diminishing returns when paying for coffee.  I think the same is true for wine.  I mean, a $200 bottle of wine might be noticeably nicer than a $50 bottle, bur a lot of people make the decision that it's not worth the extra $150.  With coffee I think the ceiling is lower.  No matter what you do, there are some bitter compounds in coffee and it is acidic.  Taste-wise, I usually feel it's pleasant at best.  I don't think I've ever had a cup of black coffee - and I drink several most days - that I thought was delicious.  It's fine. I like it. Would I call it delicious? No.\n\nIt smells great, it's a pleasant stimulant, it tastes fine - and at the end of the day, maybe the taste and smell differences between Trader Joe's and Starbucks coffee isn't worth five dollars a pound.   I like Starbucks better and I'm still trying to decide where the ceiling is for me.  Honestly, probably not much higher than that",

    "text": "Yes and no. Price and quality correlate but it's not necessarily a causal relationship.\n\n\nFirst off most people here are not from coffee producing countries, for our coffee to be cheap it needs to be intensively farmed robusta where nobody involved in producing it was paid very much, this is as it costs a lot to get here, cheap coffees will then be blended when they get here for uniformity so there is no defining origin. I've tasted mexican supermarket coffee and while it's not the most subtle roast it's very fresh arabica from a specific region in the country and does have a flavour profile reflective of that, though it is masked by the roast quality. I would imagine if I went to Mexico with a €14 250g bag of speciality roast from the same region they would think I'm insane, the improvement wouldn't be worth that much of a jump in price. By the time that coffee gets here that's just what it costs though, and that's a very basic coffee of a productive varietal with no major processing.\n\n\nWith that in mind there are those additional factors of variety, processing, and roasting that add both cost and value. Those are carefully managed in speciality coffee. An internationally respected roaster in Colombia is [Amor Perfecto](https://cafeamorperfecto.com/) if you want to try something externally verified to see if it's for you. The fact is there are more people branding and pricing themselves as producing specialty coffee than are actually producing it, so sometimes you are just paying more for very little improvement. I try to taste things or get a recommendation before buying from somewhere new because of this.\n\n\nAssuming none of this is relevant and your coffee is well produced and roasted,  it is possible you're doing something to not get the best out of it. If it's very freshly roasted it might need to rest a week or two to taste of much for example. It's possible you've always brewed your coffee to a point of bitterness where it's no longer easy to differentiate tastes. Or maybe your grinder isn't up to the task. As you already have the coffee I'd suggest try cupping it to see if there's anything you might be missing in the preparation.",

For your reference on the volvic water:\n\n\nIn terms of total TDS, 130ppm isn't too crazy for espresso and a quick calculation from Volvic's site shows that you should roughly have:\n\n\nGH: 62.8 ppm as CaCO3\nKH: 45.14 ppm as CaCO3\n\n\nCompared to some popular custom brew recipes, the GH is a bit lower than most espresso-focused water. This is because despite reasonable ppm, Volvic doesn't have a lot of Mg and Ca. The theory says this'll reduce your extraction to some extent (I think we're still missing papers though). For darker roasts I doubt that's a huge issue though.\n\n\nThe KH sits almost squarely at the lower end of the same water recipes. The higher your KH, the more of your aromatic acids in your coffee will be reduced. For darker roasts, you typically don't want as much GH and your water is actually already in a popular range for this!\n\n\nI would guess that your water is already in a pretty good spot for the types of beans that you brew.\nIf you are ever interested in lighter roasts (though I gather you don't really like them), I would go up both in GH and KH.\n\n\nYou can mix your volvic with distilled water, which will reduce both extraction and leave more acidity in your cup, which may balance out the bitterness, but that would already be a fairly unconventional brew water for espresso.

At the 4:00 mark, break the crust by passing the spoon through the cupping bowl all the way to the bottom, 3 times. Then let them cool until around 8-10m when they’re cool enough to start tasting.\n\nCup blind - label the bowls on the bottom but try not to think about what you’re tasting. 4 coffees per cupping is a good starting point; more than that is hard to keep track of. Try for some contrast.\n\nTake notes. Don’t feel bound to use a scoresheet, but write a few words for each coffee as you’re tasting. Try going down the line tasting only for acidity, or bitterness, or sweetness - jot down something about each bowl, even if it’s just “more than #2” or “ew.”\n\nDon’t judge right away. You will inevitably start tasting when things are a little too hot, and almost every coffee will improve as it cools to body temperature. Often I’ve made the mistake of writing off a bowl at the start only to find that it opens up into a floral bouquet or a delicate acidity later on.\n\nWhatever you do, don’t vary your protocol between bowls, or between cupping sessions - at least until you’ve done a few. The whole point is to standardize the brewing method to let the differences in the coffees shine through.",

If your grind size is more uniform, you will actually taste what the coffee is supposed to taste like once dialed in. The flavors will separate and you can pick out what those flavors are.

Classic Italian espresso is usually made from a blend of both Arabica and Robusta coffee, with a ratio of around 60/40. Arabica coffee is not great at producing crema and can be a bit thin. In contrast, Robusta coffee is great at producing crema, but can be too bitter for some, though it has more caffeine than Arabica.\n\nVietnamese coffee is 100% Robusta. I got my hands on a Phin filter, after going to a Vietnamese restaurant. I fell in love with the full bodied Smokey flavor. In Vietnam the government invested in the research and development of the Robusta coffee sector. It's hearty, insect resistance, and faster maturation as apposed to Arabica was an easy win. Vietnam grows about 40% of the worlds Robusta coffee. The history of how Vietnam became a world coffee producer is super interesting. I'll link a video does a good idea of explaining the key points. \n\nI roast an India Parchment Peaberry Robusta at work. It's a beautiful coffee, and is a bestseller at the cafe's. We recommend it when someone says they want strong coffee, or they need a pick-me-up(more caffeine). Because Robusta is less expensive, we often sell out, so the demand is high. As espresso pulls beautifully 1cm of long standing crema easy. It looks a amazing when pulled into a glass espresso cup, it has these three distinct layers/bands. It just takes super long time to properly dial in so we only have it on the machine maybe once a season, and only if I'm working it.",

Then let them cool until around 8-10m when they’re cool enough to start tasting.\n\nCup blind - label the bowls on the bottom but try not to think about what you’re tasting. 4 coffees per cupping is a good starting point; more than that is hard to keep track of. Try for some contrast.\n\nTake notes. Don’t feel bound to use a scoresheet, but write a few words for each coffee as you’re tasting. Try going down the line tasting only for acidity, or bitterness, or sweetness - jot down something about each bowl, even if it’s just “more than #2” or “ew.”\n\nDon’t judge right away. You will inevitably start tasting when things are a little too hot, and almost every coffee will improve as it cools to body temperature. Often I’ve made the mistake of writing off a bowl at the start only to find that it opens up into a floral bouquet or a delicate acidity later on.\n\nWhatever you do, don’t vary your protocol between bowls, or between cupping sessions - at least until you’ve done a few.

And the trouble with coffee that doesn't have a super well developed roast (medium, or medium-dark, depending on roaster; still before second crack) is that it doesn't stand up to milk well.\n\nNow there are people that are accustomed to first wave/diner coffee, and they want it like their little ceasars pizza, hot and ready. I have a family member that falls into the latter category, and while I can get her to try different lighter roast coffees, she generally likes the temperature of her cup to be much hotter than would allow more of the vibrant flavor notes to present. When someone drinks their coffee hot enough to dull any terroir nuance (as an extreme example) the best you can do is a developed roast that they complement as 'smooth'.\n\nI applaud the attempt at finding common ground, but not if it results in both needing to compromise their preferences; there is a reason 'his/her' is more than just a stereotype/meme. I'm all for having a 'safe' coffee for large batches while entertaining, but brewing two cups with different beans for two different people is not something most people looking to get into craft coffee and manual brewing would object to.",

Based on that, I started opening them at 3-4 weeks off-roast, and consuming them over the next month, so maybe up until 7-8 weeks off-roast. I always felt like 6 weeks was kind of the sweet spot, but at the same time, can't say there was much discernible drop-off going a couple of weeks beyond that. It's nice to ride the wave of changing flavours over the course of that month.\n\nThis is all anecdotal, of course. How many bags do you have at that moment and how much do you consume per day? In my opinion, freezing coffee is worthwhile only under certain circumstances (you purchase more than one of the same bag, you want to save a few single doses of a special coffee, or you seriously over-purchased). Keeping a coffee to consume within a 1-2 week period because you're afraid of a major drop-off isn't even worth considering if you're drinking light-roasted coffee.

Also, typically chocolatey notes lean more towards fidelity which can also be nice. \n\nWe should all be wary of endorsing flavors that are hardest to achieve only because they are hard to achieve — that’s how coffee becomes a fetish — the obstacle to your enjoyment becomes the object of your enjoyment. This risk isn’t unique to coffee but is certainly highly present given the whole brewing side as compared with other tasting cultures.

    "text": "Coffee Noob: replicating Starbucks Canned Espresso Light.\n\nI'm 33 years old and somehow I've gotten through life so far without drinking coffee. Like the smell but was never big on the taste.\n\nI have night owl tendencies, so generally I don't feel productive at work until the PM hours. I thought I'd give coffee another try to help me wake up faster. I picked up some Starbucks canned espresso with light cream and actually enjoyed the taste. Hard to say if the caffeine had an effect. I don't think it helped me feel more awake, but I think it got rid of some of the morning grogginess.\n\nI could just keep buying these but I'd rather opt for a cheaper bulk option. I did some searching and came across 'cold brew'. Supposedly this method results in less acidity, less bitterness, and more caffeine. So I bought Starbucks cold brew concentrate. The instructions say mix 180mL with 180 mL water. I used 180 mL milk instead. It's not as good as the canned espresso. Aftertaste is still too bitter for my liking. Maybe I need to use whole milk instead of 1%? Then I added 5g of sugar, the same amount as in the espresso. Still didn't taste as good, which makes sense because the sugar is less diluted in the espresso.\n\nThen I looked into the brewing method for the espresso. Apparently it is brewed using the ristretto method. Maybe the better taste is because of this?\n\nAny suggestions on how to replicate this flavor at home? Or is there no other way than to add more sugar and cream? Do I need an espresso machine?",

I really like the aftertaste it leaves a very pleasant mouthfeel. I think it will open up more I am still on the early side.\n\n**Subtext Daniel Caro Washed Chiroso** \\- Similar vibe to the last couple mejorados I have been trying.

I let it rest for 2 months and I still don't enjoy it. The only way I found it somewhat enjoyable was blending it with other coffee. I get a pretty bitter aftertaste and of course notes of lychee.\n\n**S&W Rwanda Dukorere Kawa Bukure Natural** \\- This one was pretty decent, not quite up to the standard of kenyas and natural ethiopias I have gotten from S&W.

I have recently done some reading about the different flavor profiles that can be achieved depending on whether you use a flat bottomed (Kalita) or conical(v60) pour-over and I found that the science matched my experience? The flat bottomed tends to give more body and the conical more acidity and floral… so, that might be a thing to consider?\n\nI have had various subscriptions through the years. To name a few: Verve (superb), Elm Roasters (delish!!), Loveless (dynamite), and most-recently SEY! These are all fairly high end roasters that are all around the same price point… the former two are on the west coast and the latter two are on the east coast… I like not having to stay on top of ordering and find a subscription handy in that it keeps me full of beans and caffeines!

That’s not what happens in the Philos. You need to dump like 30 g of beans at a time to cause a bottle neck and regrinding. Which is more than any single dose recipe calls for. \n\nSlow feeding changes the grind distribution of the system is not a new discovery. But what’s the purpose other than another way to get a different particle distribution that can be achieved by a different burr set. \n\nAs the OP discovered slow feeding changes things to the point where you can’t get grinds that extract properly even with the lowest setting. \n\nI really don’t see the point of it other than for experimentation.  There are multiple parameters that can be changed to sisal down acidity and bring out flavor notes, extraction time, temperature, pressure and  flow profiling before I’d consider feeding one bean at a time to a grinder.",

This is because despite reasonable ppm, Volvic doesn't have a lot of Mg and Ca. The theory says this'll reduce your extraction to some extent (I think we're still missing papers though). For darker roasts I doubt that's a huge issue though.\n\n\nThe KH sits almost squarely at the lower end of the same water recipes. The higher your KH, the more of your aromatic acids in your coffee will be reduced. For darker roasts, you typically don't want as much GH and your water is actually already in a popular range for this!\n\n\nI would guess that your water is already in a pretty good spot for the types of beans that you brew.\nIf you are ever interested in lighter roasts (though I gather you don't really like them), I would go up both in GH and KH.\n\n\nYou can mix your volvic with distilled water, which will reduce both extraction and leave more acidity in your cup, which may balance out the bitterness, but that would already be a fairly unconventional brew water for espresso.

To be fair Ive been drinking it at home since our conversation last week so I kind of had an idea of what I wanted, kicking around in my head. I’m decent enough at dialing in to be called “the fixer” at work. \n\nEspresso machines are crazy. Depending on the the machine and grinder setup, you have control over water volume, water temperature, water flow, grind setting, and espresso dose. This is all to achieve a an espresso shot that is roughly double the initial espresso weight you used, within the desired 20-30 second shot duration. Get any one of those things wrong and it can ruin the shot. Get them all right, your still not guaranteed something tasty. That just the initial things you have to factor in. The type of coffee, the origin, the roast level, the age of the green beans(before roasting), the age of the beans(after roasting) all have an effect on the end shot. Most people aren’t privy to all this information, and are anyways used to an espresso blend or 100% Arabica. This particular India Robusta is only peaberries, and has this syrupy consistency and a smoky/ sweet flavor, no acidity. Robusta in general has a bad reputation, but there are some really good farms/estates at the moment. Anyhow the hour long dial in estimate was based on my own experiences, and reports from customers. They were happy with the end result, but they all said it took time.",

Many people might be familiar with Monsooned Malabar, a completely different animal, which you can forget right now. This is not that.\n\nGrown on one of Indias premier Estates, Ratnagiri is Rainforest Alliance certified. There are three layers of shade cover, slowing coffee growth and boosting flavor, but also providing a habitat for 50 kinds of birds, as well as monkeys, boar, tigers, leopards, mongoose, and elephants. The area is a Unesco World Heritage site, as well as the birthplace of Indian coffee, and Ratnagiri Estate is serious about preserving the ecology, while producing excellent coffee.\n\nThis coffee is anaerobically processed: after an 84 hour extended fermentation in stainless tanks, the coffee is placed on raised beds and naturally slow-dried over 27 days. \n\nSo what do we get? For sure, notes of quality dark chocolate and roasted peanuts, but it's the berry compote, Pom juice, and ripe papaya fruit notes, with exotic spices like cardamom, nutmeg, maybe even patchouli, or mulled rum, that truly make this coffee unique. Great for drip methods and excellent for espresso!\n\n\n\n\n'reddit' is the code for 15% off sitewide! \n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.westcoastroasting.com/limited-edition/",

Like the smell but was never big on the taste.\n\nI have night owl tendencies, so generally I don't feel productive at work until the PM hours. I thought I'd give coffee another try to help me wake up faster. I picked up some Starbucks canned espresso with light cream and actually enjoyed the taste. Hard to say if the caffeine had an effect. I don't think it helped me feel more awake, but I think it got rid of some of the morning grogginess.\n\nI could just keep buying these but I'd rather opt for a cheaper bulk option. I did some searching and came across 'cold brew'. Supposedly this method results in less acidity, less bitterness, and more caffeine. So I bought Starbucks cold brew concentrate. The instructions say mix 180mL with 180 mL water. I used 180 mL milk instead. It's not as good as the canned espresso. Aftertaste is still too bitter for my liking. Maybe I need to use whole milk instead of 1%? Then I added 5g of sugar, the same amount as in the espresso. Still didn't taste as good, which makes sense because the sugar is less diluted in the espresso.\n\nThen I looked into the brewing method for the espresso. Apparently it is brewed using the ristretto method. Maybe the better taste is because of this?\n\nAny suggestions on how to replicate this flavor at home? Or is there no other way than to add more sugar and cream? Do I need an espresso machine?",

    "text": "I think you'd be hard pressed to find a cafe serving a gesha like that as an espresso.  Usually they're done as pourovers.  Not that they can't be made as an espresso.  Cafes usually have dedicated espresso grinders dialed in for specific coffees that they will be using a lot of, usually a house espresso blend and a decaf.  Some cafes do have a single-origin espresso offering, but that hopper isn't going to filled with a gesha that sells for $8-$10+ per cup.  They would be single-dosing it and likely grinding it on the same grinder they use for their batch brew coffees, and those grinders are not always set up and capable of consistently brewing good espresso.\n\nSo, it's entirely possible that a cafe could be serving a natural Panama gesha as espresso but it's not as simple as picking one of many coffees on the menu and requesting it as an espresso.",

Maybe they're a bit darker than what you usually have (though I don't know what your usual beans are), so you can experiment with grind size and temperature if you'd like.",

The biggest issue is that if you batch brew something as dense as Cometeer coffee e.g. 15 grams of coffee in, 25 grams of brew out, you'll lose 20-25 grams of brew into the coffee grounds expanding (even after pressing them with something like Aeropress). I believe espresso loses less by keeping the grounds under pressure but it's not a batch brew. \n\nBased on their patent, Cometeer deal with this by using a centrifuge to extract all the brew from the grounds. I occasionally make espressos in a batch and freeze them in silicone containers in the freezer for an americano later, the results are tasty. But it takes too much time. I mainly keep buying Cometeer. It's expensive but well-deserved imo given how hard it is to replicate at home.",

We use whole milk and I've used the exact same brand of milk for the past three years at my other cafe i worked at and have never had a problem with it! Could it be a problem with the pressure? and how should i adjust it?",

In the event where a smaller latte is made, just find the middle ground between a cappuccino and a flat white and there ya go.\n\nTraditionally, a cappuccino is almost equal parts steamed milk, milk foam and espresso where a flat white should have little to no foam and a larger proportion of steamed milk. In a roundabout way the names of the drink actually tells you exactly what it is: “flat” because there are very few bubbles, and “white” because it’s a milk drink. The names of cappuccino and caffè latte also technically tell you what they are, assuming you speak Italian and are familiar with cultural references from the 18th century, though.",

My personal preference (I have learned through brewing tons of coffee over many years) is for the Kalita Wave. I have recently done some reading about the different flavor profiles that can be achieved depending on whether you use a flat bottomed (Kalita) or conical(v60) pour-over and I found that the science matched my experience? The flat bottomed tends to give more body and the conical more acidity and floral… so, that might be a thing to consider?\n\nI have had various subscriptions through the years. To name a few: Verve (superb), Elm Roasters (delish!!), Loveless (dynamite), and most-recently SEY! These are all fairly high end roasters that are all around the same price point… the former two are on the west coast and the latter two are on the east coast… I like not having to stay on top of ordering and find a subscription handy in that it keeps me full of beans and caffeines! But, you can always just buy a bag of freshly roasted (two week after the roasting date is a real treat) coffee, chop it up and soak it in hot water (not too hot)!

They basically give you a different way of holding a handle so it's more based on leverage instead of pinching a small handle, and it makes it easier to hold without it slipping.  One of our customers thought a similar approach with latte cups could help since they usually have really small handles that can be awkward, so here I am!\n\nThat being said, this latte cup is harder to design to be comfortable compared to the mug since it's shorter and uses fewer fingers.

Like the smell but was never big on the taste.\n\nI have night owl tendencies, so generally I don't feel productive at work until the PM hours. I thought I'd give coffee another try to help me wake up faster. I picked up some Starbucks canned espresso with light cream and actually enjoyed the taste. Hard to say if the caffeine had an effect. I don't think it helped me feel more awake, but I think it got rid of some of the morning grogginess.\n\nI could just keep buying these but I'd rather opt for a cheaper bulk option. I did some searching and came across 'cold brew'. Supposedly this method results in less acidity, less bitterness, and more caffeine. So I bought Starbucks cold brew concentrate. The instructions say mix 180mL with 180 mL water. I used 180 mL milk instead. It's not as good as the canned espresso. Aftertaste is still too bitter for my liking. Maybe I need to use whole milk instead of 1%? Then I added 5g of sugar, the same amount as in the espresso. Still didn't taste as good, which makes sense because the sugar is less diluted in the espresso.\n\nThen I looked into the brewing method for the espresso. Apparently it is brewed using the ristretto method. Maybe the better taste is because of this?\n\nAny suggestions on how to replicate this flavor at home? Or is there no other way than to add more sugar and cream? Do I need an espresso machine?",

At some point the guy of the shop pointed me to the Ceado E6C as a premium single dose grinder. Honestly I have never heard of them and was curious. He was offering me it for 850€ which seems to be indeed a fair deal. But so far I was not able to find good comparable shops which are selling this grinder in Germany.\n\nDoes anyone have experience or thoughts about this company and especially their single dose E6C Modell. I was not able to find much info about it.\n\nMy main usage should be actually French press, filter and portafilter.\n\nMy current main questions are:\n\n- Are their self made 64 flat burs any good and worth?\n- what about the retention?\n- how is the support and maintenance, as I was not seeing anyone selling it online either the grinder or accessories nor the burs\n- what should be a normal reasonable good price?\n\nAlso maybe some thoughts that it looks quite similar to the DF64 models is there any relation?\n\nThank you in advance!",

The flat bottomed tends to give more body and the conical more acidity and floral… so, that might be a thing to consider?\n\nI have had various subscriptions through the years. To name a few: Verve (superb), Elm Roasters (delish!!), Loveless (dynamite), and most-recently SEY! These are all fairly high end roasters that are all around the same price point… the former two are on the west coast and the latter two are on the east coast… I like not having to stay on top of ordering and find a subscription handy in that it keeps me full of beans and caffeines! But, you can always just buy a bag of freshly roasted (two week after the roasting date is a real treat) coffee, chop it up and soak it in hot water (not too hot)! I feel like coffee and pizza are even good when they are bad 🤣",

You get like 8oz - served starbucks style. Coming from eastern europe, and being used to Turkish style coffee, which is very similar, you should get at most 4oz. That stuff is potent, not just caffeine-wise, but as far as cardamom, and in some cases sage. 8oz of that is...just too much.\n\nI'm personally not a fan of how the local Yemeni coffee houses brew. I make cardamom coffee at home sometimes, other times just plain black turkish - or sometimes with a little sugar, but this isn't like french press or pour-over. It's just too intense if you sip it like pourover.",

The biggest issue is that if you batch brew something as dense as Cometeer coffee e.g. 15 grams of coffee in, 25 grams of brew out, you'll lose 20-25 grams of brew into the coffee grounds expanding (even after pressing them with something like Aeropress). I believe espresso loses less by keeping the grounds under pressure but it's not a batch brew. \n\nBased on their patent, Cometeer deal with this by using a centrifuge to extract all the brew from the grounds. I occasionally make espressos in a batch and freeze them in silicone containers in the freezer for an americano later, the results are tasty. But it takes too much time. I mainly keep buying Cometeer. It's expensive but well-deserved imo given how hard it is to replicate at home.",

Pro-tip: toss an Aeropress filter under the grounds basket (thanks, Hoffmann fans!) for cleaner cups.

My personal preference (I have learned through brewing tons of coffee over many years) is for the Kalita Wave. I have recently done some reading about the different flavor profiles that can be achieved depending on whether you use a flat bottomed (Kalita) or conical(v60) pour-over and I found that the science matched my experience? The flat bottomed tends to give more body and the conical more acidity and floral… so, that might be a thing to consider?\n\nI have had various subscriptions through the years. To name a few: Verve (superb), Elm Roasters (delish!!), Loveless (dynamite), and most-recently SEY! These are all fairly high end roasters that are all around the same price point… the former two are on the west coast and the latter two are on the east coast… I like not having to stay on top of ordering and find a subscription handy in that it keeps me full of beans and caffeines!

The dose of the Cafflano should be about 10g, so yeah a third less coffee but with the grind size difference I would think you are doing more work in the end. Yeah the Rhinowares one looks just like my knockoff Porlex. It was night and day when I made the transition. I switch coffees fairly regularly (coffee roaster), It was always a pain dialing it in because it was always left to chance. The Comandante is not perfect but it is fairly repeatable. I have a log book of different coffees and how many “clicks” it took to get the desired result, as well as what the dose was, how it was roasted, and water temp during brewing. When I come back around to the same, or similar, coffee I have a starting point. This helps a lot when switching between filter and espresso.\n\nAlso I never quite felt like I ever got the old grinder clean. I dislike ceramic grinders because they hold onto the oil. The Comandante is stainless so its easy to clean. \n\nI don’t say any of this to imply you need to upgrade. I had the Hario Skerton for years, back when I only had the Aeropress. This duo worked for 5 or so years, before I felt the need to upgrade. I work a couple of days a week as a Barista and I get tips. This is the money I use to support my Specialty coffee purchases as well as upgrades to my set up, which is another restriction I imposed.

To be fair Ive been drinking it at home since our conversation last week so I kind of had an idea of what I wanted, kicking around in my head. I’m decent enough at dialing in to be called “the fixer” at work. \n\nEspresso machines are crazy. Depending on the the machine and grinder setup, you have control over water volume, water temperature, water flow, grind setting, and espresso dose. This is all to achieve a an espresso shot that is roughly double the initial espresso weight you used, within the desired 20-30 second shot duration. Get any one of those things wrong and it can ruin the shot. Get them all right, your still not guaranteed something tasty. That just the initial things you have to factor in. The type of coffee, the origin, the roast level, the age of the green beans(before roasting), the age of the beans(after roasting) all have an effect on the end shot. Most people aren’t privy to all this information, and are anyways used to an espresso blend or 100% Arabica. This particular India Robusta is only peaberries, and has this syrupy consistency and a smoky/ sweet flavor, no acidity. Robusta in general has a bad reputation, but there are some really good farms/estates at the moment. Anyhow the hour long dial in estimate was based on my own experiences, and reports from customers.

    "text": "Nope, the hype around Arabica coffee being the best is purely based on marketing. Classic Italian espresso is usually made from a blend of both Arabica and Robusta coffee, with a ratio of around 60/40. Arabica coffee is not great at producing crema and can be a bit thin. In contrast, Robusta coffee is great at producing crema, but can be too bitter for some, though it has more caffeine than Arabica.\n\nVietnamese coffee is 100% Robusta. I got my hands on a Phin filter, after going to a Vietnamese restaurant. I fell in love with the full bodied Smokey flavor. In Vietnam the government invested in the research and development of the Robusta coffee sector. It's hearty, insect resistance, and faster maturation as apposed to Arabica was an easy win. Vietnam grows about 40% of the worlds Robusta coffee. The history of how Vietnam became a world coffee producer is super interesting. I'll link a video does a good idea of explaining the key points. \n\nI roast an India Parchment Peaberry Robusta at work. It's a beautiful coffee, and is a bestseller at the cafe's. We recommend it when someone says they want strong coffee, or they need a pick-me-up(more caffeine). Because Robusta is less expensive, we often sell out, so the demand is high. As espresso pulls beautifully 1cm of long standing crema easy. It looks a amazing when pulled into a glass espresso cup, it has these three distinct layers/bands. It just takes super long time to properly dial in so we only have it on the machine maybe once a season, and only if I'm working it.",

Coffee has these foaming agents in it that trap the CO2 as its escaping from the solution after being under pressure. Along with fine coffee particles this collectively gets called \"Crema\". If you ever taste crema by itself its not very tasty. We have a $26,000 espresso machine at work and depending on the age, and type of coffee we are pulling we can get beautiful photo worthy shots(that taste terrible) or ugly as hell shots(that taste great) and everything in between. I was trained by this \"Old School\" Barista a few years ago. He really drilled into me the finer points of dialing in espresso. Coffee that is between 10 days and a month old pulls the best in my opinion. For best taste I find most coffees fall between 10 and 20 days (as espresso).

I sometimes think about working as a barista, but I would be cracked out after drinking more than 2 espressos a day.   \n\n\nWow all that work for a good shot of espresso.

    "text": "That cafflano does look cool, as an all in one travel brewer. The pouring lid looks a little inconsistent(for my workflow) as a daily driver though . I think I would be upgrading to a Hario air kettle, as soon as I was able. Still… That may be making it’s way into a travel kit at some point.\n\nI dialed in the India robusta this morning, at the main cafe. It only took me 3 attempts to pull something drinkable. By the 6th pull it was something enjoyable, so maybe 6-7 min to dial in this morning.  To be fair Ive been drinking it at home since our conversation last week so I kind of had an idea of what I wanted, kicking around in my head. I’m decent enough at dialing in to be called “the fixer” at work. \n\nEspresso machines are crazy. Depending on the the machine and grinder setup, you have control over water volume, water temperature, water flow, grind setting, and espresso dose. This is all to achieve a an espresso shot that is roughly double the initial espresso weight you used, within the desired 20-30 second shot duration. Get any one of those things wrong and it can ruin the shot. Get them all right, your still not guaranteed something tasty. That just the initial things you have to factor in. The type of coffee, the origin, the roast level, the age of the green beans(before roasting), the age of the beans(after roasting) all have an effect on the end shot. Most people aren’t privy to all this information, and are anyways used to an espresso blend or 100% Arabica. This particular India Robusta is only peaberries, and has this syrupy consistency and a smoky/ sweet flavor, no acidity. Robusta in general has a bad reputation, but there are some really good farms/estates at the moment. Anyhow the hour long dial in estimate was based on my own experiences, and reports from customers. They were happy with the end result, but they all said it took time.",

    "text": "Nope, the hype around Arabica coffee being the best is purely based on marketing. Classic Italian espresso is usually made from a blend of both Arabica and Robusta coffee, with a ratio of around 60/40. Arabica coffee is not great at producing crema and can be a bit thin. In contrast, Robusta coffee is great at producing crema, but can be too bitter for some, though it has more caffeine than Arabica.\n\nVietnamese coffee is 100% Robusta. I got my hands on a Phin filter, after going to a Vietnamese restaurant. I fell in love with the full bodied Smokey flavor. In Vietnam the government invested in the research and development of the Robusta coffee sector. It's hearty, insect resistance, and faster maturation as apposed to Arabica was an easy win. Vietnam grows about 40% of the worlds Robusta coffee. The history of how Vietnam became a world coffee producer is super interesting. I'll link a video does a good idea of explaining the key points. \n\nI roast an India Parchment Peaberry Robusta at work. It's a beautiful coffee, and is a bestseller at the cafe's. We recommend it when someone says they want strong coffee, or they need a pick-me-up(more caffeine). Because Robusta is less expensive, we often sell out, so the demand is high. As espresso pulls beautifully 1cm of long standing crema easy. It looks a amazing when pulled into a glass espresso cup, it has these three distinct layers/bands. It just takes super long time to properly dial in so we only have it on the machine maybe once a season, and only if I'm working it.",

I have my coffee station pic posted on here, you can see it my profile if you haven't already checked. \n\nCrema is kind of a misnomer as a scale for good espresso. Coffee has these foaming agents in it that trap the CO2 as its escaping from the solution after being under pressure. Along with fine coffee particles this collectively gets called \"Crema\". If you ever taste crema by itself its not very tasty. We have a $26,000 espresso machine at work and depending on the age, and type of coffee we are pulling we can get beautiful photo worthy shots(that taste terrible) or ugly as hell shots(that taste great) and everything in between. I was trained by this \"Old School\" Barista a few years ago. He really drilled into me the finer points of dialing in espresso. Coffee that is between 10 days and a month old pulls the best in my opinion. For best taste I find most coffees fall between 10 and 20 days (as espresso). If its an Arabica/Robusta blend or pure Robusta your guaranteed crema in most cases. 100% Arabica will have crema for a short while, but don't expect the mouthfeel be on par with a blend.",

I really like the aftertaste it leaves a very pleasant mouthfeel. I think it will open up more I am still on the early side.\n\n**Subtext Daniel Caro Washed Chiroso** \\- Similar vibe to the last couple mejorados I have been trying.

This works well for Ethiopians. \n\nStalling and long draw down is almost always related to fines migrating and clogging up the filter. So, fewer pours will be better, avoiding swirls will be better and subsequent pours before the prior fully drawn down will generally be better.\n\nEdit: I pretty much use 6.0 on ode 2 for almost every brew.  Know that your Ethiopian bean will have fines, no matter the grind setting.   If you stay at 5 and do single pour, it will brew in under two minutes and will be quite well extracted for the time it took.  (I stir with chopstick when I single pour).",

    "text": "**Subtext Raquel Lasso Washed Gesha** \\- Unlike any washed gesha I have tried. First cup I was hit in the face with sweet tropical fruit but very little acidity. Second cup was more acid forward and I got more raspberry notes which I enjoyed more. It honestly tastes more like a natural process than a washed process bean. I really like the aftertaste it leaves a very pleasant mouthfeel. I think it will open up more I am still on the early side.\n\n**Subtext Daniel Caro Washed Chiroso** \\- Similar vibe to the last couple mejorados I have been trying. Dates and stone fruit is mostly what I get. I love this cup profile. If the rest of my daily cups could just taste like this bag I would be happy. It has been very easy to brew and lovely.\n\n**Subtext Sebastian Garces Washed Enepei** \\- Never heard of this varietal before, not sure it is even technically a true varietal yet. This may be the first time I have not gotten anything resembling the notes on the bag from Subtext. They note cola, red apple, and blue fruit. My cups have been pretty hollow and woody/green tasting. I am hoping if I let it rest longer I get something more enjoyable. My first real miss after trying 8+ bags of Subtext.\n\nI still think their reserve subscription is the best subscription I have tried for the price and I am bummed I am skipping next month after I saw what they are offering.\n\n**S&W Colombia Santa Monica Lychee Coferment** \\- I kinda knew going into it that I would not like this coffee. I let it rest for 2 months and I still don't enjoy it. The only way I found it somewhat enjoyable was blending it with other coffee. I get a pretty bitter aftertaste and of course notes of lychee.\n\n**S&W Rwanda Dukorere Kawa Bukure Natural** \\- This one was pretty decent, not quite up to the standard of kenyas and natural ethiopias I have gotten from S&W. Which was kinda to be expected but I like trying other countries in africa. I have had good cups from Burundi, Congo, and Uganda. I noted plum and black tea notes. Was hoping for more berry/stone fruit, but the acidity/tartness wasn't coming through for me.",

    "text": "Totally true about those \"ungodly great beans\" - I've found the best way to discover them is actually keeping a really basic log of what you liked and why. After blowing too much cash on fancy beans that didnt click with me, I started writing batch numbers and origins down with quick notes like \"fruity\" or \"chocolate bomb\" or just \"meh\". Now I kinda know what regions I prefer for espresso (Ethiopia and Colombia usually slap) and which roasters nail my preferred profile. Water quality matters almost as much tho - when i moved apartments my exact same bean setup suddenly tasted totally different until I started filtering.",

    "text": "I would look for a middle ground, the beans you bought were $40 USD/lb in Colombia, that's an incredibly expensive coffee. I would never pay that without being very familiar with the roaster and the origin and knowing that I'm gonna enjoy it. And even then, maybe once a decade?\n\n\nI pay around $13-18/lb in the US ($13 is direct from the roaster who I've been buying from for 15 years and have a friendship with) and I am more than satisfied with the quality.\n\n\nI think you'll be more likely satisfied if you start at more of the lower end of specialty so you can explore the options (origin, wash type, roast level, roaster) without feeling like you're splurging on a luxury good.",

    "text": "Yes and no. Price and quality correlate but it's not necessarily a causal relationship.\n\n\nFirst off most people here are not from coffee producing countries, for our coffee to be cheap it needs to be intensively farmed robusta where nobody involved in producing it was paid very much, this is as it costs a lot to get here, cheap coffees will then be blended when they get here for uniformity so there is no defining origin. I've tasted mexican supermarket coffee and while it's not the most subtle roast it's very fresh arabica from a specific region in the country and does have a flavour profile reflective of that, though it is masked by the roast quality. I would imagine if I went to Mexico with a €14 250g bag of speciality roast from the same region they would think I'm insane, the improvement wouldn't be worth that much of a jump in price. By the time that coffee gets here that's just what it costs though, and that's a very basic coffee of a productive varietal with no major processing.\n\n\nWith that in mind there are those additional factors of variety, processing, and roasting that add both cost and value. Those are carefully managed in speciality coffee. An internationally respected roaster in Colombia is [Amor Perfecto](https://cafeamorperfecto.com/) if you want to try something externally verified to see if it's for you. The fact is there are more people branding and pricing themselves as producing specialty coffee than are actually producing it, so sometimes you are just paying more for very little improvement. I try to taste things or get a recommendation before buying from somewhere new because of this.\n\n\nAssuming none of this is relevant and your coffee is well produced and roasted,  it is possible you're doing something to not get the best out of it. If it's very freshly roasted it might need to rest a week or two to taste of much for example. It's possible you've always brewed your coffee to a point of bitterness where it's no longer easy to differentiate tastes. Or maybe your grinder isn't up to the task. As you already have the coffee I'd suggest try cupping it to see if there's anything you might be missing in the preparation.",

Acidity is still not quite there.\n- [Maria Delgado (Colombian Caturra)](https://www.subtext.coffee/collections/filter-coffee-beans/products/colombia-maria-delgado-washed-caturra): very juicy and \"nostalgic\" washed Colombian profile, which a classic malic warmth in finish. Unapologetically fruity.\n- [Alirio Ortega (Colombian Pacamara)](https://www.subtext.coffee/collections/filter-coffee-beans/products/alirio-munoz-ortega-washed-pacamara): also juicy, though a bit fresher and underdeveloped.\n- **Sebastian Garces (Ecuadorian Enepei)**: still dialing in this one — it exhibits some of those less desirable roasty/earthy qualities I've occasionally experienced from Ecuadorian coffees. Hopefully I'll get it right soon!\n\nI think I'm finally learning that 1) I'm not *generally* a huge fan of geshas (too delicate) and 2) I'm not the biggest fan of Ecuadorian coffees (with exceptions) and 3) \"boring\" washed Colombian coffees rarely disappoint me (because they're juicy and vibrant) :D",

    "text": "Just coming back from a 2 week trip around Taiwan and echo the statement. I was surprised and impressed by the quality of coffee there. Also just the abundance of great coffee shops and the pour over selection. Coming from the UK coffee shops are still very much espresso dominated and my local places (not based in London) have maybe 3 different beans on offer for pour over if I'm lucky. I think my favourite was Rufous in Taipei but I also just enjoyed the atmosphere and decor there. Had a super floral Colombian coffee there. Also the abundance of Geisha on offer, went to a random breakfast place in Kaohsiung and they served a great Geisha as pour over with some nice savoury kimchi pancakes. \nThe coffee beans from Taiwan I was able to try as pour over were also very good but found them quite expensive so didn't end up buying any (got some Oolong tea from Taiwan instead). Haven't been to Japan recently so can't compare it to the coffee culture there but compared to the UK it's so much better",

With a thermal shock wine yeast anaerobic pink bourbon from wilton benitez, one might have a very clear sense that it tastes like strawberry yogurt and rhubarb and thereby conclude it to be a high clarity presentation of those flavors, but with a washed colombian coffee from Prodigal, clarity would present in a way that’s less based on the intensity of flavor distinction than the fleeting complexity that its lighter body allows for and makes possible",
