Like the smell but was never big on the taste.\n\nI have night owl tendencies, so generally I don't feel productive at work until the PM hours. I thought I'd give coffee another try to help me wake up faster. I picked up some Starbucks canned espresso with light cream and actually enjoyed the taste. Hard to say if the caffeine had an effect.

The instructions say mix 180mL with 180 mL water. I used 180 mL milk instead. It's not as good as the canned espresso. Aftertaste is still too bitter for my liking. Maybe I need to use whole milk instead of 1%? Then I added 5g of sugar, the same amount as in the espresso. Still didn't taste as good, which makes sense because the sugar is less diluted in the espresso.\n\nThen I looked into the brewing method for the espresso. Apparently it is brewed using the ristretto method. Maybe the better taste is because of this?\n\nAny suggestions on how to replicate this flavor at home? Or is there no other way than to add more sugar and cream? Do I need an espresso machine?",

Percolators are easy to get wrong.  You need to pay attention to perk time from the beginning of water appearing in the knob.  Different people like different spans.  Also, the rate of percolation is critical.  At a rolling boil, the water is too hot.  On a gas stove, I run the burner just a little above low and time the process from when it first starts to actually perk, not the first time water appears in the bulb, but a few seconds later when it starts repeating.  Up to that point, the heat is on high.  I turn the gas down to \\_near\\_ low and let it go.  Once my preferred cooking time is up, I pull it off the heat.  While many like to keep their coffee warm somehow, this gradually makes the coffee increasingly bitter.  My parents used to keep the pot warm on the stove on the smallest gas burner.  That creates a corrosively bitter, acidic coffee, drinkable only with lots of cream and sugar, and I prefer either black or just a little added milk.  I find it easier to just reheat the coffee by the cup in a microwave or on the stove in a small sauce pan.",

I have recently done some reading about the different flavor profiles that can be achieved depending on whether you use a flat bottomed (Kalita) or conical(v60) pour-over and I found that the science matched my experience? The flat bottomed tends to give more body and the conical more acidity and floral… so, that might be a thing to consider?\n\nI have had various subscriptions through the years. To name a few: Verve (superb), Elm Roasters (delish!!), Loveless (dynamite), and most-recently SEY! These are all fairly high end roasters that are all around the same price point… the former two are on the west coast and the latter two are on the east coast… I like not having to stay on top of ordering and find a subscription handy in that it keeps me full of beans and caffeines!

What I'm thinking right now is to get a good grinder first, and good enough espresso machine just to see whether I want to invest more in the future.\n\nGrinder: Timemore 078s.\n- Aesthetic is a big factor for me 😅\n- Good enough for both expresso and pour over. \n- I'm not a fan of grinder with bellow. So a lot of models are not included with this criteria alone. DF 64, Eureka Mignon. \n- Other alternatives I might be considering is Fellow Opus, or Niche Zero.\n- Not planning to go too much higher than current pricing bracket as it'll be my first purchase. And I'm not from US/EU. Even $100 translates to a considerable big amount of money in my country.\n- I'm aware that Timemore have it's own issues. But I did read great reviews too. It's a gamble in a way, I guess.\n\nEspresso machine: Delongi ECP 3420.\n- Overall seems cheap and good enough.\n\nMy question is whether this is a good plan?

Many people might be familiar with Monsooned Malabar, a completely different animal, which you can forget right now. This is not that.\n\nGrown on one of Indias premier Estates, Ratnagiri is Rainforest Alliance certified. There are three layers of shade cover, slowing coffee growth and boosting flavor, but also providing a habitat for 50 kinds of birds, as well as monkeys, boar, tigers, leopards, mongoose, and elephants. The area is a Unesco World Heritage site, as well as the birthplace of Indian coffee, and Ratnagiri Estate is serious about preserving the ecology, while producing excellent coffee.\n\nThis coffee is anaerobically processed: after an 84 hour extended fermentation in stainless tanks, the coffee is placed on raised beds and naturally slow-dried over 27 days. \n\nSo what do we get? For sure, notes of quality dark chocolate and roasted peanuts, but it's the berry compote, Pom juice, and ripe papaya fruit notes, with exotic spices like cardamom, nutmeg, maybe even patchouli, or mulled rum, that truly make this coffee unique. Great for drip methods and excellent for espresso!\n\n\n\n\n'reddit' is the code for 15% off sitewide! \n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.westcoastroasting.com/limited-edition/",

The mindful preparation method and wait might make be less likely to brew as much coffee because I'll have to boil the water first.

My personal preference (I have learned through brewing tons of coffee over many years) is for the Kalita Wave. I have recently done some reading about the different flavor profiles that can be achieved depending on whether you use a flat bottomed (Kalita) or conical(v60) pour-over and I found that the science matched my experience? The flat bottomed tends to give more body and the conical more acidity and floral… so, that might be a thing to consider?\n\nI have had various subscriptions through the years. To name a few: Verve (superb), Elm Roasters (delish!!), Loveless (dynamite), and most-recently SEY! These are all fairly high end roasters that are all around the same price point… the former two are on the west coast and the latter two are on the east coast… I like not having to stay on top of ordering and find a subscription handy in that it keeps me full of beans and caffeines! But, you can always just buy a bag of freshly roasted (two week after the roasting date is a real treat) coffee, chop it up and soak it in hot water (not too hot)! I feel like coffee and pizza are even good when they are bad 🤣",

Coming from eastern europe, and being used to Turkish style coffee, which is very similar, you should get at most 4oz. That stuff is potent, not just caffeine-wise, but as far as cardamom, and in some cases sage. 8oz of that is...just too much.\n\nI'm personally not a fan of how the local Yemeni coffee houses brew. I make cardamom coffee at home sometimes, other times just plain black turkish - or sometimes with a little sugar, but this isn't like french press or pour-over.

My first real miss after trying 8+ bags of Subtext.\n\nI still think their reserve subscription is the best subscription I have tried for the price and I am bummed I am skipping next month after I saw what they are offering.\n\n**S&W Colombia Santa Monica Lychee Coferment** \\- I kinda knew going into it that I would not like this coffee. I let it rest for 2 months and I still don't enjoy it. The only way I found it somewhat enjoyable was blending it with other coffee. I get a pretty bitter aftertaste and of course notes of lychee.\n\n**S&W Rwanda Dukorere Kawa Bukure Natural** \\- This one was pretty decent, not quite up to the standard of kenyas and natural ethiopias I have gotten from S&W. Which was kinda to be expected but I like trying other countries in africa. I have had good cups from Burundi, Congo, and Uganda. I noted plum and black tea notes. Was hoping for more berry/stone fruit, but the acidity/tartness wasn't coming through for me.",

It’s been an amazing journey to say the least and now I’d like to start exploring coffee from other regions (definitely keeping my eye out for Colombia and Guatemala beans)",

Second cup was more acid forward and I got more raspberry notes which I enjoyed more. It honestly tastes more like a natural process than a washed process bean. I really like the aftertaste it leaves a very pleasant mouthfeel. I think it will open up more I am still on the early side.\n\n**Subtext Daniel Caro Washed Chiroso** \\- Similar vibe to the last couple mejorados I have been trying. Dates and stone fruit is mostly what I get. I love this cup profile. If the rest of my daily cups could just taste like this bag I would be happy. It has been very easy to brew and lovely.\n\n**Subtext Sebastian Garces Washed Enepei** \\- Never heard of this varietal before, not sure it is even technically a true varietal yet.

After blowing too much cash on fancy beans that didnt click with me, I started writing batch numbers and origins down with quick notes like \"fruity\" or \"chocolate bomb\" or just \"meh\". Now I kinda know what regions I prefer for espresso (Ethiopia and Colombia usually slap) and which roasters nail my preferred profile. Water quality matters almost as much tho - when i moved apartments my exact same bean setup suddenly tasted totally different until I started filtering.",

I would never pay that without being very familiar with the roaster and the origin and knowing that I'm gonna enjoy it. And even then, maybe once a decade?\n\n\nI pay around $13-18/lb in the US ($13 is direct from the roaster who I've been buying from for 15 years and have a friendship with) and I am more than satisfied with the quality.\n\n\nI think you'll be more likely satisfied if you start at more of the lower end of specialty so you can explore the options (origin, wash type, roast level, roaster) without feeling like you're splurging on a luxury good.",
